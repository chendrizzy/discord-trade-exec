## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues are detected, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Feature Flag Disable (Immediate - 30 seconds)

```bash
railway variables --set "BROKER_INTEGRATIONS_ENABLED=false"
railway restart
```

**Impact**: Broker integrations disabled, users can't configure brokers

### Option 2: Disable Specific Broker (1 minute)

```bash
railway variables --set "ALLOWED_BROKERS=alpaca,schwab"  # Remove ibkr, moomoo, etc.
railway restart
```

**Impact**: Specific broker disabled, others remain functional

### Option 3: Full Rollback (2-3 minutes)

```bash
railway rollback  # Rollback to previous deployment
```

**Impact**: Complete rollback to previous working version
