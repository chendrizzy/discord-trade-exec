# Week 3: Broker Integrations Deployment - Railway Aligned

**Status**: Ready for Production Deployment
**Platform**: Railway (aligned with Week 2 WebSocket deployment)
**Code Status**: ✅ DEVELOPMENT COMPLETE (62/70 tasks, 88.6%)
**Tests Status**: ✅ 74 adapter tests passing (32 IBKR + 42 Schwab)

---

## Overview

This deployment plan aligns broker integrations deployment with the Railway platform already established in Week 2 for WebSocket services. We're skipping Docker-based staging in favor of Railway's native deployment features.

### Why Railway?

✅ **Already Configured**: Week 2 established Railway deployment with Redis
✅ **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Health checks, monitoring, rollback capabilities
✅ **Simpler Deployment**: No Docker setup required
✅ **Consistent Platform**: Same deployment platform for all services
✅ **Built-in Staging**: Railway supports multiple environments natively

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Readiness
- [x] IBKRAdapter complete with 32 tests passing
- [x] SchwabAdapter complete with 42 tests passing
- [x] AlpacaAdapter complete (existing)
- [x] UI components complete (BrokerConfigWizard, BrokerManagement)
- [x] API endpoints complete (/api/brokers/*)
- [x] Security complete (encryption, rate limiting, premium gating)
- [x] Documentation complete (BROKER-SETUP.md)

### Environment Configuration

Required Railway environment variables (add to existing):

```bash
# AWS KMS for credential encryption
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
AWS_KMS_KEY_ID=<your-kms-key-id>

# Feature flags
BROKER_INTEGRATIONS_ENABLED=true
BROKER_INTEGRATIONS_PREMIUM_ONLY=true
ALLOWED_BROKERS=alpaca,ibkr,schwab

# Rate limits (optional - defaults are set in code)
IBKR_RATE_LIMIT=50
SCHWAB_RATE_LIMIT=120
ALPACA_RATE_LIMIT=200
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Current Railway Status

```bash
# Check Railway project link
railway status

# Expected output:
# Project: discord-trade-exec
# Environment: production
# Service: discord-trade-exec
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Set broker integration environment variables
railway variables set AWS_REGION=us-east-1
railway variables set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
railway variables set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret>
railway variables set AWS_KMS_KEY_ID=<your-kms-key>

railway variables set BROKER_INTEGRATIONS_ENABLED=true
railway variables set BROKER_INTEGRATIONS_PREMIUM_ONLY=true
railway variables set ALLOWED_BROKERS="alpaca,ibkr,schwab"

# Verify
railway variables | grep -E '(AWS|BROKER)'
```

### Step 3: Run Pre-Deployment Tests

```bash
# Run all broker adapter tests
npm test -- src/brokers/adapters/__tests__/

# Expected: 74 tests passing (32 IBKR + 42 Schwab)

# Run integration tests
npm test -- src/routes/api/__tests__/brokers.integration.test.js

# Run middleware tests
npm test -- src/middleware/__tests__/premiumGating.test.js
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Deploy current codebase
railway up

# Monitor deployment
railway logs --tail

# Expected: Successful deployment with no errors
```

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Validation

```bash
# Get Railway URL
RAILWAY_URL=$(railway variables | grep RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN | cut -d'=' -f2)

# Test health check
curl https://$RAILWAY_URL/health

# Test broker endpoints (requires authentication)
curl https://$RAILWAY_URL/api/brokers/supported

# Expected: List of supported brokers
```

---

## Validation Tests

### Test Broker Connection Endpoint

```bash
# Test IBKR connection (requires valid paper trading credentials)
curl -X POST https://$RAILWAY_URL/api/brokers/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-token>" \
  -d '{
    "brokerKey": "ibkr",
    "credentials": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 7497,
      "clientId": 1
    },
    "environment": "testnet"
  }'

# Expected: Connection successful with balance data
```

### Test Premium Gating

```bash
# Test with free tier user (should fail)
curl -X POST https://$RAILWAY_URL/api/brokers/configure \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <free-user-token>" \
  -d '{"brokerKey": "ibkr", ...}'

# Expected: 403 Forbidden - Premium tier required
```

### Test Rate Limiting

```bash
# Test IBKR rate limit (50 req/s)
for i in {1..60}; do
  curl -X GET https://$RAILWAY_URL/api/brokers/user/configured \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-token>" &
done
wait

# Expected: Some requests return 429 Too Many Requests
```

## Monitoring Setup

### Railway Dashboard

1. Go to Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Metrics** tab
3. Monitor:
   - CPU usage (should be <50% under normal load)
   - Memory usage (should be <80% of limit)
   - Request rate
   - Error rate

### Application Metrics

The application already has metrics endpoints from Week 2:

```bash
# View application metrics
curl https://$RAILWAY_URL/metrics

# Expected: WebSocket stats + broker stats
{
  "websocket": {
    "totalConnections": 150,
    "uniqueUsers": 75
  },
  "brokers": {
    "totalConnections": 25,
    "connectedBrokers": {
      "ibkr": 10,
      "schwab": 8,
      "alpaca": 7
    }
  },
  "system": {
    "uptime": 86400,
    "memory": {...}
  }
}
```

### Set Up Alerts

Configure Railway webhooks for:
- Deployment failures
- High error rates (>5%)
- Memory usage >90%
- Connection failures

---

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected:

```bash
# Option 1: Feature flag disable (immediate)
railway variables set BROKER_INTEGRATIONS_ENABLED=false
railway restart

# Option 2: Full rollback
railway status  # Get current deployment ID
railway rollback  # Rollback to previous deployment

# Option 3: Disable specific broker
railway variables set ALLOWED_BROKERS="alpaca,schwab"  # Remove ibkr
railway restart
```

## Key Differences from Docker-Based Deployment Guide

| Aspect | Docker-Based (DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) | Railway-Based (This Plan) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Platform | Docker + Docker Compose | Railway (PaaS) |
| Staging | Separate Docker environment | Railway staging environment |
| Deployment | docker-compose up | railway up |
| Environment Variables | .env.staging file | railway variables |
| Database | Manual setup | Managed by Railway |
| Redis | Manual setup | Already configured (Week 2) |
| Rollback | docker-compose down + restore | railway rollback |
| Monitoring | Custom DataDog setup | Railway built-in + metrics endpoint |
| Health Checks | curl localhost:3000/health | Railway health checks |

- **Day 3**: Invite beta users (5-10 premium subscribers)
- **Day 4**: Monitor beta usage, collect feedback
- **Day 5**: Fix issues, prepare GA launch
- **Day 6**: General availability launch, announcements
- **Day 7**: Monitor conversion metrics, user adoption

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**:
1. ✅ Verify Railway project link
2. ⏳ Set AWS KMS environment variables for credential encryption
3. ⏳ Deploy broker integrations to Railway
4. ⏳ Run post-deployment validation tests
5. ⏳ Test with paper trading accounts

**Questions for User**:
- Do you have AWS KMS credentials ready for credential encryption?
- Should we deploy immediately or wait for approval?
- Do you want to test in Railway staging environment first?
