## üîß Changes Deployed

### Code Changes

**File**: `src/dashboard/components/LiveWatchlist.jsx`

**Change 1** (Line 41):
```javascript
// BEFORE (INCORRECT):
const unsubscribe = subscribe('quote:update', data => {

// AFTER (CORRECT):
const unsubscribe = subscribe('watchlist:quote', data => {
```

**Change 2** (Line 13, JSDoc):
```javascript
// BEFORE:
 * - Subscribe to 'quote:update' events

// AFTER:
 * - Subscribe to 'watchlist:quote' events
```

**Reason**: Server emits `watchlist:quote` but client was listening for `quote:update`, preventing real-time updates.

### Components Verified Operational

1. **PortfolioOverview.jsx** ‚úÖ
   - Event: `portfolio:update` (CORRECT)
   - Real-time portfolio value updates
   - Active bots tracking
   - 24h P&L display
   - Animated sparkline charts

2. **TradeNotifications.jsx** ‚úÖ
   - Events: `trade:executed`, `trade:failed` (CORRECT)
   - Toast notification system
   - Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
   - Success/error styling
   - Slide-in animations

3. **LiveWatchlist.jsx** ‚úÖ (FIXED)
   - Event: `watchlist:quote` (FIXED from `quote:update`)
   - Real-time quote updates
   - Price change animations (green ‚ñ≤, red ‚ñº)
   - Add/remove symbols
   - Volume and change % display

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues are detected, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Git Revert (Immediate - 1 minute)

```bash
# Revert the LiveWatchlist fix
git revert 339a05e
git push origin main

# Railway auto-deploys the revert
```

**Impact**: LiveWatchlist reverts to old event name (`quote:update`), real-time quotes stop working

### Option 2: Feature Flag Disable (2 minutes)

```bash
# Disable WebSocket features
railway variables --set "WEBSOCKET_FEATURES_ENABLED=false"
railway restart
```

**Impact**: All WebSocket features disabled, dashboard reverts to polling

### Option 3: Full Rollback (3 minutes)

```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
railway rollback

# Or rollback to specific commit
git reset --hard 6940017  # Before LiveWatchlist fix
git push origin main --force
```

**Impact**: Complete rollback to previous working version

## üìã Known Issues & Limitations

### Memory Usage (Non-Blocking)

**Observation**: Heap memory at 96.9% utilization (120.7MB/124.4MB)

**Impact**: Normal for Node.js applications, V8 GC manages this automatically

**Action**: Monitor for memory leaks during production use

**Mitigation**: If memory grows continuously:
- Check for event listener leaks in WebSocket subscriptions
- Verify cleanup in `useEffect` return functions
- Consider increasing heap size: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=512`

### Test Coverage (Pending)

**Status**: Comprehensive test strategy created, tests not yet implemented

**Next Steps**:
- Implement unit tests for components (Day 2)
- Implement integration tests for WebSocket flows (Day 2)
- Implement E2E tests with Playwright (Day 3)

**Target Coverage**:
- Server emitters: 90%+
- React components: 85%+
- WebSocket hook: 95%+
- Integration flows: 85%+
