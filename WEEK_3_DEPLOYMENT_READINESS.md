## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

- **Code Quality**: 280 tests passing, comprehensive coverage
- **Platform Alignment**: Using established Railway deployment
- **Infrastructure**: Redis, MongoDB already configured
- **Security**: AWS KMS encryption implemented and tested
- **Rollback**: Railway rollback capability available

### Medium Risk ⚠️

- **AWS KMS Configuration**: First-time setup, needs testing
- **Broker API Integrations**: External dependencies on broker APIs
- **Rate Limiting**: Needs production validation with real traffic

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Feature Flags**: Can disable immediately if issues detected
   ```bash
   railway variables set BROKER_INTEGRATIONS_ENABLED=false
   railway restart
   ```

2. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with 5-10 beta users before GA

3. **Monitoring**: Track connection success rates and error rates

4. **Rollback**: Railway rollback to previous deployment if needed
   ```bash
   railway rollback
   ```
