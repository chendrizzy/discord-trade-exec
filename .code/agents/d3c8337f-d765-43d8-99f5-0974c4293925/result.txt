# Feature Specification: OpenSpec to Speckit Migration

**Feature Branch**: `001-openspec-to-speckit-migration`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Comprehensive migration from OpenSpec to Speckit workflow system, encompassing entire Discord Trade Executor project with all planned features, marking completed tasks, and tracking incomplete work from OpenSpec proposals

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Trade Execution (Priority: P1) ✅

Traders receive signals in Discord from providers, and the system automatically executes those trades across their connected broker accounts without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - the primary reason users subscribe to the platform. Without this, there is no product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by posting "BUY AAPL @ $150, SL $145, TP $160" in Discord and verifying trade appears in Alpaca account within 30 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has connected Alpaca account with valid credentials, **When** signal provider posts "BUY AAPL @ $150" in monitored Discord channel, **Then** system parses signal with 95%+ accuracy and executes market order in user's Alpaca account

**Gathering full specification details**

I'm realizing the spec might be too large and truncated, so I'll try fetching additional lines to get a complete view of all user stories and statuses. This way, I can analyze progress percentages and references to OpenSpec more thoroughly.

- Implement advanced segmentation (user personas)
- Create automated email campaigns for at-risk users
- Develop LTV:CAC ratio tracking

### User Story 8 - Moomoo Integration (Priority: P2) ✅

Traders connect their Moomoo brokerage accounts to execute trades from Discord signals, with dedicated UI for API key management and connection status.

**Why this priority**: Market expansion - Moomoo popular among Asian markets and younger retail traders. Adds competitive differentiation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to broker settings, selecting "Add Moomoo", entering API credentials, and verifying connection test passes with green status indicator.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects Moomoo from broker list, **When** enters API key and secret, **Then** system validates credentials via test API call and stores encrypted if valid
2. **Given** Moomoo account connected, **When** stock signal received (e.g., "BUY BABA @ $80"), **Then** order routed to Moomoo API and executed
3. **Given** Moomoo API returns error, **When** trade attempted, **Then** user sees error notification with actionable message (e.g., "Insufficient buying power")
4. **Given** user viewing broker status dashboard, **When** Moomoo connection healthy, **Then** green checkmark displayed with last successful ping timestamp

# OpenSpec Instructions

Instructions for AI coding assistants using OpenSpec for spec-driven development.

## TL;DR Quick Checklist

- Search existing work: `openspec spec list --long`, `openspec list` (use `rg` only for full-text search)
- Decide scope: new capability vs modify existing capability
- Pick a unique `change-id`: kebab-case, verb-led (`add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`)
- Scaffold: `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md` (only if needed), and delta specs per affected capability
- Write deltas: use `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements`; include at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement
- Validate: `openspec validate [change-id] --strict` and fix issues
- Request approval: Do not start implementation until proposal is approved

## Three-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Creating Changes
Create proposal when you need to:
- Add features or functionality
- Make breaking changes (API, schema)

**Summarizing Speckit user stories and progress**

**Speckit Overview**
- Single active Speckit spec located at `specs/001-openspec-to-speckit-migration/spec.md:1`; captures migration from OpenSpec proposals into Speckit user stories and phased roadmap.
- Migration consolidates 13 OpenSpec changes; 3 fully delivered, 6 in progress, 4 proposed/conceptual; ~45 % (449/992) tasks complete.

**Migration Highlights**
- Completed OpenSpec changes: add-moomoo-ui-support, add-polymarket-intelligence, baseline automated trade execution (US‑1, US‑4, US‑8).
- Active developments map to OpenSpec IDs with explicit task counts (e.g., implement-broker-integrations, implement-realtime-infrastructure, implement-unified-oauth2-authentication, implement-analytics-platform, implement-crypto-exchanges).
- Proposed initiatives retain OpenSpec linkage for future planning (implement-dual-dashboard-system, migrate-to-railway, implement-analytics-advanced-features, implement-social-trading).
