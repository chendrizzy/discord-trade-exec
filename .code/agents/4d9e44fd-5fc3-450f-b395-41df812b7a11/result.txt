Okay, I will perform the requested edits. First, I need to read the `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` file.I see. The items you mentioned (`implement-unified-oauth2-authentication`, `implement-dual-dashboard-system`, etc.) are not present in the `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` file I have access to. It's possible you're referring to a different file or a different version of this one. Could you please clarify which file I should be editing?Right, `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` both exist. I'll check `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the content.This file, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, isn't it either. I've checked both `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` without success. I'll now search the entire project for the string `implement-unified-oauth2-authentication` to locate the correct file.`openspec` directory files are the main hits. `specs/001-openspec-to-speckit-migration/spec.md` looks like the best bet with its status table. I'll read it.Okay, I've located the correct file: `specs/001-openspec-to-speckit-migration/spec.md`. I will now update the "Migration Status Tracking" and "Implementation Phases" sections to reflect the requested changes, including updating statuses, adding the new `implement-production-redis-caching` story, and appending the sync log. I'm executing the replacement now.Okay, `spec.md` is modified. Now, I'll reread it to verify.File updated. I've completed the edits as requested: `implement-unified-oauth2-authentication` status is updated, `implement-dual-dashboard-system` is now blocked, `add-polymarket-intelligence` reflects pending phases, `implement-production-redis-caching` is added, and the sync log is appended. Request complete.
