Review `openspec/project.md`, `openspec list`, and `openspec list --specs` to understand current context.\n2. Choose a unique verb-led `change-id` and scaffold `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, optional `design.md`, and spec deltas under `openspec/changes/<id>/`.\n3. Draft spec deltas using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement.\n4. Run `openspec validate <id> --strict` and resolve any issues before sharing the proposal.\n\n### Stage 2: Implementing Changes\nTrack these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.\n1. **Read proposal.md** - Understand what's being built\n2. **Read design.md** (if exists) - Review technical decisions\n3. **Read tasks.md** - Get implementation checklist\n4. **Implement tasks sequentially** - Complete in order\n5. **Confirm completion** - Ensure every item in `tasks.md` is finished before updating statuses\n6. **Update checklist** - After all work is done, set every task to `- [x]` so the list reflects reality\n7. **Approval gate** - Do not start implementation until the proposal is reviewed and approved\n\n### Stage 3: Archiving Changes\nAfter deployment, create separate PR to:\n- Move `changes/[name]/` ‚Üí `changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/`\n- Update `specs/` if capabilities changed\n- Use `openspec archive [change] --skip-specs --yes` for tooling-only changes\n- Run `openspec validate --strict` to confirm the archived change passes checks\n\n## Before Any Task\n\n**Context Checklist:**\n- [ ] Read relevant specs in `specs/[capability]/spec.md`\n- [ ] Check pending changes in `changes/` for conflicts\n- [ ] Read `openspec/project.md` for conventions\n- [ ] Run `openspec list` to see active changes\n- [ ] Run `openspec list --specs` to see existing capabilities\n\n**Before Creating Specs:**\n- Always check if capability already exists\n- Prefer modifying existing specs over creating duplicates\n- Use `openspec show [spec]` to review current state\n- If request is ambiguous, ask 1‚Äì2 clarifying questions before scaffolding\n\n### Search Guidance\n- Enumerate specs: `openspec spec list --long` (or `--json` for scripts)\n- Enumerate changes: `openspec list` (or `openspec change list --json` - deprecated but available)\n- Show details:\n  - Spec: `openspec show <spec-id> --type spec` (use `--json` for filters)\n  - Change: `openspec show <change-id> --json --deltas-only`\n- Full-text search (use ripgrep): `rg -n \"Requirement:|Scenario:\" openspec/specs`\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### CLI Commands\n\n```bash\n# Essential commands\nopenspec list                  # List active changes\nopenspec list --specs          # List specifications\nopenspec show [item]           # Display change or spec\nopenspec diff [change]         # Show spec differences\nopenspec validate [item]       # Validate changes or specs\nopenspec archive [change] [--yes|-y]      # Archive after deployment (add --yes for non-interactive runs)\n\n# Project management\nopenspec init [path]           # Initialize OpenSpec\nopenspec update [path]         # Update instruction files\n\n# Interactive mode\nopenspec show                  # Prompts for selection\nopenspec validate              # Bulk validation mode\n\n# Debugging\nopenspec show [change] --json --deltas-only\nopenspec validate [change] --strict\n```\n\n### Command Flags\n\n- `--json` - Machine-readable output\n- `--type change|spec` - Disambiguate items\n- `--strict` - Comprehensive validation\n- `--no-interactive` - Disable prompts\n- `--skip-specs` - Archive without spec updates\n- `--yes`/`-y` - Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive archive)\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nopenspec/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project.md              # Project conventions\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/                  # Current truth - what IS built\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [capability]/       # Single focused capability\n‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md         # Requirements and scenarios\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md       # Technical patterns\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ changes/                # Proposals - what SHOULD change\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [change-name]/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proposal.md     # Why, what, impact\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md        # Implementation checklist\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md       # Technical decisions (optional; see criteria)\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/          # Delta changes\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [capability]/\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md # ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/            # Completed changes\n```\n\n## Creating Change Proposals\n\n### Decision Tree\n\n```\nNew request?\n‚îú‚îÄ Bug fix restoring spec behavior?

‚Üí Create proposal (safer)\n```\n\n### Proposal Structure\n\n1. **Create directory:** `changes/[change-id]/` (kebab-case, verb-led, unique)\n\n2. **Write proposal.md:**\n```markdown\n## Why\n[1-2 sentences on problem/opportunity]\n\n## What Changes\n- [Bullet list of changes]\n- [Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**]\n\n## Impact\n- Affected specs: [list capabilities]\n- Affected code: [key files/systems]\n```\n\n3. **Create spec deltas:** `specs/[capability]/spec.md`\n```markdown\n## ADDED Requirements\n### Requirement: New Feature\nThe system SHALL provide...\n\n#### Scenario: Success case\n- **WHEN** user performs action\n- **THEN** expected result\n\n## MODIFIED Requirements\n### Requirement: Existing Feature\n[Complete modified requirement]\n\n## REMOVED Requirements\n### Requirement: Old Feature\n**Reason**: [Why removing]\n**Migration**: [How to handle]\n```\nIf multiple capabilities are affected, create multiple delta files under `changes/[change-id]/specs/<capability>/spec.md`‚Äîone per capability.\n\n4. **Create tasks.md:**\n```markdown\n## 1. Implementation\n- [ ] 1.1 Create database schema\n- [ ] 1.2 Implement API endpoint\n- [ ] 1.3 Add frontend component\n- [ ] 1.4 Write tests\n```\n\n5. **Create design.md when needed:**\nCreate `design.md` if any of the following apply; otherwise omit it:\n- Cross-cutting change (multiple services/modules) or a new architectural pattern\n- New external dependency or significant data model changes\n- Security, performance, or migration complexity\n- Ambiguity that benefits from technical decisions before coding\n\nMinimal `design.md` skeleton:\n```markdown\n## Context\n[Background, constraints, stakeholders]\n\n## Goals / Non-Goals\n- Goals: [...]\n- Non-Goals: [...]\n\n## Decisions\n- Decision: [What and why]\n- Alternatives considered: [Options + rationale]\n\n## Risks / Trade-offs\n- [Risk] ‚Üí Mitigation\n\n## Migration Plan\n[Steps, rollback]\n\n## Open Questions\n- [...]\n```\n\n## Spec File Format\n\n### Critical: Scenario Formatting\n\n**CORRECT** (use #### headers):\n```markdown\n#### Scenario: User login success\n- **WHEN** valid credentials provided\n- **THEN** return JWT token\n```\n\n**WRONG** (don't use bullets or bold):\n```markdown\n- **Scenario: User login**  ‚ùå\n**Scenario**: User login     ‚ùå\n### Scenario: User login      ‚ùå\n```\n\nEvery requirement MUST have at least one scenario.\n\n### Requirement Wording\n- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may unless intentionally non-normative)\n\n### Delta Operations\n\n- `## ADDED Requirements` - New capabilities\n- `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changed behavior\n- `## REMOVED Requirements` - Deprecated features\n- `## RENAMED Requirements` - Name changes\n\nHeaders matched with `trim(header)` - whitespace ignored.\n\n#### When to use ADDED vs MODIFIED\n- ADDED: Introduces a new capability or sub-capability that can stand alone as a requirement. Prefer ADDED when the change is orthogonal (e.g., adding \"Slash Command Configuration\") rather than altering the semantics of an existing requirement.\n- MODIFIED: Changes the behavior, scope, or acceptance criteria of an existing requirement. Always paste the full, updated requirement content (header + all scenarios). The archiver will replace the entire requirement with what you provide here; partial deltas will drop previous details.\n- RENAMED: Use when only the name changes. If you also change behavior, use RENAMED (name) plus MODIFIED (content) referencing the new name.\n\nCommon pitfall: Using MODIFIED to add a new concern without including the previous text. This causes loss of detail at archive time. If you aren‚Äôt explicitly changing the existing requirement, add a new requirement under ADDED instead.\n\nAuthoring a MODIFIED requirement correctly:\n1) Locate the existing requirement in `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`.\n2) Copy the entire requirement block (from `### Requirement: ...` through its scenarios).\n3) Paste it under `## MODIFIED Requirements` and edit to reflect the new behavior.\n4) Ensure the header text matches exactly (whitespace-insensitive) and keep at least one `#### Scenario:`.\n\nExample for RENAMED:\n```markdown\n## RENAMED Requirements\n- FROM: `### Requirement: Login`\n- TO: `### Requirement: User Authentication`\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors\n\n**\"Change must have at least one delta\"**\n- Check `changes/[name]/specs/` exists with .md files\n- Verify files have operation prefixes (## ADDED Requirements)\n\n**\"Requirement must have at least one scenario\"**\n- Check scenarios use `#### Scenario:` format (4 hashtags)\n- Don't use bullet points or bold for scenario headers\n\n**Silent scenario parsing failures**\n- Exact format required: `#### Scenario: Name`\n- Debug with: `openspec show [change] --json --deltas-only`\n\n### Validation Tips\n\n```bash\n# Always use strict mode for comprehensive checks\nopenspec validate [change] --strict\n\n# Debug delta parsing\nopenspec show [change] --json | jq '.deltas'\n\n# Check specific requirement\nopenspec show [spec] --json -r 1\n```\n\n## Happy Path Script\n\n```bash\n# 1) Explore current state\nopenspec spec list --long\nopenspec list\n# Optional full-text search:\n# rg -n \"Requirement:|Scenario:\" openspec/specs\n# rg -n \"^#|Requirement:\" openspec/changes\n\n# 2) Choose change id and scaffold\nCHANGE=add-two-factor-auth\nmkdir -p openspec/changes/$CHANGE/{specs/auth}\nprintf \"## Why\\n...\\n\\n## What Changes\\n- ...\\n\\n## Impact\\n- ...\\n\" > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/proposal.md\nprintf \"## 1.

Implementation\n- [ ] 1.1 Create database schema\n- [ ] 1.2 Implement API endpoint\n- [ ] 1.3 Add frontend component\n- [ ] 1.4 Write tests\n```\n\n5. **Create design.md when needed:**\nCreate `design.md` if any of the following apply; otherwise omit it:\n- Cross-cutting change (multiple services/modules) or a new architectural pattern\n- New external dependency or significant data model changes\n- Security, performance, or migration complexity\n- Ambiguity that benefits from technical decisions before coding\n\nMinimal `design.md` skeleton:\n```markdown\n## Context\n[Background, constraints, stakeholders]\n\n## Goals / Non-Goals\n- Goals: [...]\n- Non-Goals: [...]\n\n## Decisions\n- Decision: [What and why]\n- Alternatives considered: [Options + rationale]\n\n## Risks / Trade-offs\n- [Risk] ‚Üí Mitigation\n\n## Migration Plan\n[Steps, rollback]\n\n## Open Questions\n- [...]\n```\n\n## Spec File Format\n\n### Critical: Scenario Formatting\n\n**CORRECT** (use #### headers):\n```markdown\n#### Scenario: User login success\n- **WHEN** valid credentials provided\n- **THEN** return JWT token\n```\n\n**WRONG** (don't use bullets or bold):\n```markdown\n- **Scenario: User login**  ‚ùå\n**Scenario**: User login     ‚ùå\n### Scenario: User login      ‚ùå\n```\n\nEvery requirement MUST have at least one scenario.\n\n### Requirement Wording\n- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may unless intentionally non-normative)\n\n### Delta Operations\n\n- `## ADDED Requirements` - New capabilities\n- `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changed behavior\n- `## REMOVED Requirements` - Deprecated features\n- `## RENAMED Requirements` - Name changes\n\nHeaders matched with `trim(header)` - whitespace ignored.\n\n#### When to use ADDED vs MODIFIED\n- ADDED: Introduces a new capability or sub-capability that can stand alone as a requirement. Prefer ADDED when the change is orthogonal (e.g., adding \"Slash Command Configuration\") rather than altering the semantics of an existing requirement.\n- MODIFIED: Changes the behavior, scope, or acceptance criteria of an existing requirement. Always paste the full, updated requirement content (header + all scenarios). The archiver will replace the entire requirement with what you provide here; partial deltas will drop previous details.\n- RENAMED: Use when only the name changes. If you also change behavior, use RENAMED (name) plus MODIFIED (content) referencing the new name.\n\nCommon pitfall: Using MODIFIED to add a new concern without including the previous text. This causes loss of detail at archive time. If you aren‚Äôt explicitly changing the existing requirement, add a new requirement under ADDED instead.\n\nAuthoring a MODIFIED requirement correctly:\n1) Locate the existing requirement in `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`.\n2) Copy the entire requirement block (from `### Requirement: ...` through its scenarios).\n3) Paste it under `## MODIFIED Requirements` and edit to reflect the new behavior.\n4) Ensure the header text matches exactly (whitespace-insensitive) and keep at least one `#### Scenario:`.\n\nExample for RENAMED:\n```markdown\n## RENAMED Requirements\n- FROM: `### Requirement: Login`\n- TO: `### Requirement: User Authentication`\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors\n\n**\"Change must have at least one delta\"**\n- Check `changes/[name]/specs/` exists with .md files\n- Verify files have operation prefixes (## ADDED Requirements)\n\n**\"Requirement must have at least one scenario\"**\n- Check scenarios use `#### Scenario:` format (4 hashtags)\n- Don't use bullet points or bold for scenario headers\n\n**Silent scenario parsing failures**\n- Exact format required: `#### Scenario: Name`\n- Debug with: `openspec show [change] --json --deltas-only`\n\n### Validation Tips\n\n```bash\n# Always use strict mode for comprehensive checks\nopenspec validate [change] --strict\n\n# Debug delta parsing\nopenspec show [change] --json | jq '.deltas'\n\n# Check specific requirement\nopenspec show [spec] --json -r 1\n```\n\n## Happy Path Script\n\n```bash\n# 1) Explore current state\nopenspec spec list --long\nopenspec list\n# Optional full-text search:\n# rg -n \"Requirement:|Scenario:\" openspec/specs\n# rg -n \"^#|Requirement:\" openspec/changes\n\n# 2) Choose change id and scaffold\nCHANGE=add-two-factor-auth\nmkdir -p openspec/changes/$CHANGE/{specs/auth}\nprintf \"## Why\\n...\\n\\n## What Changes\\n- ...\\n\\n## Impact\\n- ...\\n\" > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/proposal.md\nprintf \"## 1.

Without this, there is no product.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by posting \"BUY AAPL @ $150, SL $145, TP $160\" in Discord and verifying trade appears in Alpaca account within 30 seconds.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** user has connected Alpaca account with valid credentials, **When** signal provider posts \"BUY AAPL @ $150\" in monitored Discord channel, **Then** system parses signal with 95%+ accuracy and executes market order in user's Alpaca account\n2. **Given** user has position size limit of $5000, **When** signal for $10000 position received, **Then** system scales down to $5000 respecting risk parameters\n3. **Given** user has stop-loss enabled, **When** trade executed, **Then** stop-loss order placed at specified price automatically\n4. **Given** signal contains invalid ticker symbol, **When** parsed, **Then** system logs error and notifies user without executing trade\n\n**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (OpenSpec: automated trade execution baseline)\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Multi-Broker Integration (Priority: P1) ‚è≥\n\nTraders can connect multiple broker accounts (stocks and crypto) from a single dashboard, with the system securely managing API credentials and routing trades to the appropriate broker.\n\n**Why this priority**: Platform differentiation - supporting 8+ brokers allows users to consolidate their trading automation in one place rather than using separate systems for stocks/crypto.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting both Alpaca (stocks) and Coinbase Pro (crypto) accounts, then executing signals for AAPL and BTC-USD to verify proper broker routing.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** user navigates to broker settings, **When** selects \"Add Broker\" and chooses IBKR, **Then** system redirects to OAuth2 flow and stores encrypted credentials after authorization\n2. **Given** user has both Alpaca and Binance connected, **When** stock signal received, **Then** system routes to Alpaca; when crypto signal received, routes to Binance\n3. **Given** user's Alpaca credentials expire, **When** OAuth2 token refresh scheduled, **Then** system automatically renews tokens without user intervention\n4. **Given** user disconnects broker, **When** signal arrives for that broker's assets, **Then** system skips execution and logs informational message\n\n**Status**: ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS (88.6% - 62/70 tasks complete in OpenSpec: implement-broker-integrations)\n\n**Completed Brokers**:\n- ‚úÖ IBKR (Interactive Brokers) - OAuth2 + trade execution\n- ‚úÖ Charles Schwab - OAuth2 + trade execution\n- ‚úÖ Alpaca - API key + trade execution\n- ‚úÖ Coinbase Pro - API key + trade execution\n- ‚úÖ Kraken - API key + trade execution\n\n**Pending Work**:\n- Deploy broker adapters to production\n- Implement broker health monitoring\n- Create user-facing broker status dashboard\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Real-Time Dashboard Updates (Priority: P2) ‚è≥\n\nUsers see live updates on their dashboard as trades execute, positions change, and alerts fire without needing to refresh the page.\n\n**Why this priority**: Modern UX expectation - users expect real-time updates in 2025. Reduces support burden from \"why isn't my trade showing?\" questions.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening dashboard, executing trade via signal, and verifying dashboard updates within 2 seconds without page refresh.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** user has dashboard open, **When** trade executes, **Then** trade appears in history table within 2 seconds via WebSocket push\n2. **Given** user monitoring portfolio value, **When** market prices change, **Then** portfolio value updates in real-time (max 5s latency)\n3. **Given** user loses internet connection, **When** connection restored, **Then** WebSocket reconnects automatically and resynchronizes state\n4. **Given** 10,000 concurrent users, **When** market volatility causes high update frequency, **Then** system maintains <2s update latency for 95th percentile\n\n**Status**: ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS (6.8% - 10/148 tasks complete in OpenSpec: implement-realtime-infrastructure)\n\n**Completed Work**:\n- ‚úÖ Basic WebSocket connection infrastructure\n- ‚úÖ Trade execution event broadcasting\n\n**Pending Work** (138 tasks):\n- Implement BullMQ job queues for background processing\n- Create portfolio value calculation service\n- Build real-time price feed integration\n- Develop connection health monitoring\n- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Polymarket Intelligence (Priority: P2) ‚úÖ\n\nCommunity hosts monitor Polymarket whale wallets and anomalous trading patterns via a dedicated intelligence dashboard, with automated alerts when significant activity detected.\n\n**Why this priority**: Premium feature that differentiates platform for crypto-focused communities. High engagement driver (users check whale activity multiple times per day).\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to Polymarket Intelligence tab and verifying whale wallet positions displayed, then simulating $50K+ trade to trigger whale alert notification.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** whale wallet has >$100K position in market, **When** user views whale leaderboard, **Then** wallet appears ranked by total position size with real-time balance\n2. **Given** new whale wallet (>$100K) enters market, **When** detection algorithm runs, **Then** automated alert sent to Discord webhook within 5 minutes\n3. **Given** anomaly detection enabled, **When** trading volume spikes 3+ standard deviations above mean, **Then** alert fired and highlighted on dashboard\n4. **Given** user filters by specific market, **When** selecting market from dropdown, **Then** only positions and alerts for that market displayed\n\n**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (OpenSpec: add-polymarket-intelligence Phase 1 & 2 complete)\n\n**Key Capabilities**:\n- Polygon blockchain monitoring via Alchemy\n- CTF Exchange contract position tracking\n- Whale detection algorithm (>$100K positions)\n- Anomaly detection using statistical analysis\n- Real-time alert system via Discord webhooks\n- Historical trend visualization with Recharts\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Dual Dashboard System (Priority: P2) üü°\n\nThe system automatically detects user role (community host vs. individual trader) and routes them to the appropriate dashboard with role-specific features and navigation.\n\n**Why this priority**: Critical for UX scaling - prevents confusion as platform grows two distinct user segments with different needs. Community hosts need member management; traders need signal feeds.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as community host account and verifying redirect to `/community-dashboard` with member management visible, then logging in as trader account and verifying redirect to `/trader-dashboard` with signal feed.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** user registers as \"Community Host\" role, **When** completes OAuth2 login, **Then** redirected to `/community-dashboard` with navigation showing Members, Signals, Billing tabs\n2. **Given** user has \"Trader\" role, **When** logs in, **Then** redirected to `/trader-dashboard` with navigation showing Feed, Brokers, History, Risk Settings\n3. **Given** community host viewing member list, **When** clicks member name, **Then** modal shows member's subscription tier, trade stats, and broker connections\n4. **Given** trader following 3 signal providers, **When** viewing signal feed, **Then** only signals from followed providers displayed with filtering options\n\n**Status**: üü° STAGING READY (90% - 194/216 tasks complete in `openspec/changes/implement-dual-dashboard-system/tasks.md`)\n\n**Current State**:\n- ‚úÖ Phase 1 routing + role detection fully implemented (48/48 tests passing)\n- üì¶ Phases 2 & 3 dashboards scaffolded with UI fully in place but awaiting data wiring\n- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production blocker: Redis cache still using in-memory fallback (see `implement-production-redis-caching` tasks)\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Integrate live data sources (MongoDB analytics, Discord API, broker health) into scaffolds\n- Provision production Redis instance and flip feature flags once caching online\n- Run staging validation covering host/trader flows before GA\n\n**Planned Components**:\n- Community Dashboard: Overview, Signal Management, Member Management, Analytics, Billing, Integrations\n- Trader Dashboard: Overview, Signal Feed, Broker Management, Trade History, Risk Settings, Notifications, Subscription\n- Role-based routing middleware\n- Shared component library for common UI elements\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Unified OAuth2 Authentication (Priority: P1) ‚è≥\n\nUsers authenticate once via Discord OAuth2 and the system maintains their session across all features, with broker OAuth2 tokens automatically refreshed before expiration.\n\n**Why this priority**: Security and UX foundation - poor session management causes user frustration and support burden.

Not immediately actionable but guides strategic decisions.\n\n**Independent Test**: Conceptual vision, no single independent test. Success measured by achieving 10K+ active users, $500K+ ARR, and 5+ white-label partners.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** platform at scale, **When** 10,000 concurrent users, **Then** system maintains <2s latency for 95% of requests with 99.9% uptime\n2. **Given** white-label licensing available, **When** signal provider purchases license, **Then** customized platform deployed with their branding within 24 hours\n3. **Given** multi-asset support expanded, **When** user wants to trade options, **Then** options signals parsed and executed via supported brokers (IBKR, TD Ameritrade)\n4. **Given** mobile app launched, **When** trade executes, **Then** push notification sent to user's phone within 5 seconds\n\n**Status**: üîÆ CONCEPTUAL (long-term vision, no specific tasks)\n\n**Vision Elements**:\n- Scale to 10K+ concurrent users\n- White-label licensing for signal providers\n- Multi-asset expansion (options, futures, forex)\n- Mobile app (iOS/Android) with push notifications\n- Institutional-grade API for algorithmic traders\n- International expansion (EU, Asia markets)\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **What happens when Discord API rate limit exceeded?** - System queues pending signal parses, implements exponential backoff, and resumes when rate limit resets. User sees \"Signal processing delayed\" notification.\n\n- **How does system handle broker API downtime?** - Adapter implements circuit breaker pattern: after 3 consecutive failures, marks broker as \"degraded\" for 5 minutes, notifies user, and skips trade execution during outage.\n\n- **What if user's broker account has insufficient buying power?** - Trade fails with clear error message: \"Insufficient buying power: $500 available, $1000 required.\" User can adjust position sizing or deposit funds.\n\n- **How to prevent duplicate trade execution if signal re-posted?** - System maintains signal deduplication cache (Redis) with 24-hour TTL, keyed by signal content hash. Duplicate signals logged but not executed.\n\n- **What if OAuth2 refresh token revoked by broker?** - Refresh job fails, user flagged as \"re-authorization required,\" email notification sent, dashboard banner displayed with \"Reconnect [Broker]\" button.\n\n- **How does session management work with multiple devices?** - MongoDB-backed sessions allow concurrent login from multiple devices. Last-write-wins for settings changes. WebSocket broadcasts sync state across all open tabs.\n\n- **What happens during MongoDB connection loss?** - Application retry logic attempts reconnection with exponential backoff (max 30s). Read operations fail gracefully with cached data; writes queued and flushed on reconnection.\n\n- **How to handle Stripe webhook signature failures?** - Invalid signatures rejected with 400 error logged to security audit trail. Legitimate webhooks retried by Stripe up to 3 days.\n\n- **What if user deletes Discord account mid-subscription?** - Subscription remains active (Stripe billing), but user cannot login. Support intervention required to migrate to email-based auth or refund.\n\n- **How does system handle market closed hours for stock signals?** - Signals parsed and validated immediately; orders queued as \"pending market open.\" Executed at next market open (9:30 AM ET). User notified of delay.\n\n---\n",

Required before scaling to 1000+ users.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying to Railway staging environment, triggering auto-scale by simulating 500 concurrent WebSocket connections, and verifying new instances spin up within 60 seconds.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** Railway project configured with `railway.toml`, **When** git push to main branch, **Then** automated deployment triggers and completes within 5 minutes with zero downtime\n2. **Given** CPU usage exceeds 70% for 2 minutes, **When** Railway auto-scaling enabled, **Then** new instance provisioned and added to load balancer pool\n3. **Given** health check endpoint at `/health`, **When** Railway monitoring pings endpoint, **Then** returns 200 OK with uptime and version info\n4. **Given** environment variables configured in Railway dashboard, **When** deployment occurs, **Then** secrets injected at runtime without exposing in logs\n\n**Status**: üîÆ PROPOSED (0/106 tasks in OpenSpec: migrate-to-railway)\n\n**Planned Work**:\n- Create Railway project and configure services\n- Migrate environment variables to Railway\n- Set up MongoDB Atlas connection\n- Configure custom domain with SSL\n- Implement health check endpoints\n- Set up auto-scaling policies\n- Create staging and production environments\n\n---\n\n### User Story 12 - Crypto Exchange Expansion (Priority: P2) ‚è≥\n\nTraders connect additional cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Gemini, Bybit) beyond Coinbase/Kraken, with unified order management and cross-exchange arbitrage detection.\n\n**Why this priority**: Market coverage - different users have accounts on different exchanges. Supporting top 5 exchanges captures 90% of retail crypto traders.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting Binance account, posting \"BUY BTC-USDT @ $45000\" signal, and verifying order executes on Binance with confirmation displayed on dashboard.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** user selects Binance from broker list, **When** enters API key/secret, **Then** system validates credentials via Binance API and stores encrypted\n2. **Given** Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken all connected, **When** BTC signal received, **Then** user can select preferred exchange or system routes to exchange with best price\n3. **Given** user has positions on multiple exchanges, **When** viewing portfolio, **Then** aggregated view shows total crypto holdings with per-exchange breakdown\n4. **Given** arbitrage detection enabled, **When** BTC price differs >1% across exchanges, **Then** alert fired suggesting arbitrage opportunity\n\n**Status**: ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS (68.75% - 44/64 tasks complete in OpenSpec: implement-crypto-exchanges)\n\n**Completed Work**:\n- ‚úÖ Coinbase Pro adapter (CCXT-based)\n- ‚úÖ Kraken adapter (CCXT-based)\n- ‚úÖ Multi-exchange portfolio aggregation\n- ‚úÖ Exchange selection UI\n\n**Pending Work** (20 tasks):\n- Implement Binance adapter\n- Add Gemini adapter\n- Build arbitrage detection algorithm\n- Create exchange comparison tool (fees, liquidity)\n\n---\n\n### User Story 13 - Full Platform Vision (Priority: P3) üîÆ\n\nDiscord Trade Executor becomes a comprehensive trading automation ecosystem with social features, advanced analytics, multi-asset support, and white-label licensing for signal providers.\n\n**Why this priority**: Long-term vision - defines 2-3 year product roadmap. Not immediately actionable but guides strategic decisions.\n\n**Independent Test**: Conceptual vision, no single independent test. Success measured by achieving 10K+ active users, $500K+ ARR, and 5+ white-label partners.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** platform at scale, **When** 10,000 concurrent users, **Then** system maintains <2s latency for 95% of requests with 99.9% uptime\n2. **Given** white-label licensing available, **When** signal provider purchases license, **Then** customized platform deployed with their branding within 24 hours\n3. **Given** multi-asset support expanded, **When** user wants to trade options, **Then** options signals parsed and executed via supported brokers (IBKR, TD Ameritrade)\n4. **Given** mobile app launched, **When** trade executes, **Then** push notification sent to user's phone within 5 seconds\n\n**Status**: üîÆ CONCEPTUAL (long-term vision, no specific tasks)\n\n**Vision Elements**:\n- Scale to 10K+ concurrent users\n- White-label licensing for signal providers\n- Multi-asset expansion (options, futures, forex)\n- Mobile app (iOS/Android) with push notifications\n- Institutional-grade API for algorithmic traders\n- International expansion (EU, Asia markets)\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **What happens when Discord API rate limit exceeded?** - System queues pending signal parses, implements exponential backoff, and resumes when rate limit resets. User sees \"Signal processing delayed\" notification.\n\n- **How does system handle broker API downtime?** - Adapter implements circuit breaker pattern: after 3 consecutive failures, marks broker as \"degraded\" for 5 minutes, notifies user, and skips trade execution during outage.\n\n- **What if user's broker account has insufficient buying power?** - Trade fails with clear error message: \"Insufficient buying power: $500 available, $1000 required.\" User can adjust position sizing or deposit funds.\n\n- **How to prevent duplicate trade execution if signal re-posted?** - System maintains signal deduplication cache (Redis) with 24-hour TTL, keyed by signal content hash. Duplicate signals logged but not executed.\n\n- **What if OAuth2 refresh token revoked by broker?** - Refresh job fails, user flagged as \"re-authorization required,\" email notification sent, dashboard banner displayed with \"Reconnect [Broker]\" button.\n\n- **How does session management work with multiple devices?** - MongoDB-backed sessions allow concurrent login from multiple devices. Last-write-wins for settings changes. WebSocket broadcasts sync state across all open tabs.\n\n- **What happens during MongoDB connection loss?** - Application retry logic attempts reconnection with exponential backoff (max 30s). Read operations fail gracefully with cached data; writes queued and flushed on reconnection.\n\n- **How to handle Stripe webhook signature failures?** - Invalid signatures rejected with 400 error logged to security audit trail. Legitimate webhooks retried by Stripe up to 3 days.\n\n- **What if user deletes Discord account mid-subscription?** - Subscription remains active (Stripe billing), but user cannot login. Support intervention required to migrate to email-based auth or refund.\n\n- **How does system handle market closed hours for stock signals?** - Signals parsed and validated immediately; orders queued as \"pending market open.\" Executed at next market open (9:30 AM ET). User notified of delay.\n\n---\n"
