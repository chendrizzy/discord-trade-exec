**Evaluating read-only editing constraints**

I'm sorting out how to handle a read-only sandbox environment where I can't actually edit files, yet the task expects a diff or modification. I’m thinking I can generate a hypothetical diff without applying it, starting by reading relevant spec files and considering if I should use the sequential thinking tool to plan the multi-step update process carefully.

# OpenSpec Instructions

Instructions for AI coding assistants using OpenSpec for spec-driven development.

## TL;DR Quick Checklist

- Search existing work: `openspec spec list --long`, `openspec list` (use `rg` only for full-text search)
- Decide scope: new capability vs modify existing capability
- Pick a unique `change-id`: kebab-case, verb-led (`add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`)
- Scaffold: `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md` (only if needed), and delta specs per affected capability
- Write deltas: use `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements`; include at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement
- Validate: `openspec validate [change-id] --strict` and fix issues
- Request approval: Do not start implementation until proposal is approved

## Three-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Creating Changes
Create proposal when you need to:
- Add features or functionality
- Make breaking changes (API, schema)

# Feature Specification: OpenSpec to Speckit Migration

**Feature Branch**: `001-openspec-to-speckit-migration`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Comprehensive migration from OpenSpec to Speckit workflow system, encompassing entire Discord Trade Executor project with all planned features, marking completed tasks, and tracking incomplete work from OpenSpec proposals

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Trade Execution (Priority: P1) ✅

Traders receive signals in Discord from providers, and the system automatically executes those trades across their connected broker accounts without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - the primary reason users subscribe to the platform. Without this, there is no product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by posting "BUY AAPL @ $150, SL $145, TP $160" in Discord and verifying trade appears in Alpaca account within 30 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has connected Alpaca account with valid credentials, **When** signal provider posts "BUY AAPL @ $150" in monitored Discord channel, **Then** system parses signal with 95%+ accuracy and executes market order in user's Alpaca account

- Implement advanced segmentation (user personas)
- Create automated email campaigns for at-risk users
- Develop LTV:CAC ratio tracking

---

### User Story 8 - Moomoo Integration (Priority: P2) ✅

Traders connect their Moomoo brokerage accounts to execute trades from Discord signals, with dedicated UI for API key management and connection status.

**Why this priority**: Market expansion - Moomoo popular among Asian markets and younger retail traders. Adds competitive differentiation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to broker settings, selecting "Add Moomoo", entering API credentials, and verifying connection test passes with green status indicator.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects Moomoo from broker list, **When** enters API key and secret, **Then** system validates credentials via test API call and stores encrypted if valid
2. **Given** Moomoo account connected, **When** stock signal received (e.g., "BUY BABA @ $80"), **Then** order routed to Moomoo API and executed
3. **Given** Moomoo API returns error, **When** trade attempted, **Then** user sees error notification with actionable message (e.g., "Insufficient buying power")
4. **Given** user viewing broker status dashboard, **When** Moomoo connection healthy, **Then** green checkmark displayed with last successful ping timestamp

**Preparing detailed status update diff**

I'll create a carefully crafted unified diff that updates multiple status lines to reflect new progress percentages, changes task counts to maintain consistency, adds a blocker notice with a link for Redis provisioning under the dual dashboard section, inserts a new explicit blocked entry for the production Redis caching feature, and appends a brief sync log summarizing these adjustments near the end of the spec document. I'll keep changes minimal and maintain formatting consistency while including appropriate emoji statuses and relative task links.

**Preparing detailed spec status updates diff**

I’m putting together a focused diff to revise status lines for three features—unified OAuth2, dual dashboard, and Polymarket intelligence—to reflect current progress and blockers, including adding a supporting redis caching entry near dual dashboard. I’ll also append a brief sync log near the doc’s end, keeping changes minimal and consistent with existing emoji/status styles.
