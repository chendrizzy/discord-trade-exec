## Scripts Overview

### Production Deployment

#### `validate-websocket-deployment.js`
**Purpose**: Validates WebSocket integration deployment to production (Week 3 Track B)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Quick validation (6 tests, ~30 seconds)
npm run deploy:validate

# Comprehensive validation (7 tests with performance metrics)
npm run deploy:validate:comprehensive

# Custom deployment URL
DEPLOYMENT_URL=https://your-custom-url.com npm run deploy:validate
```

**Tests**:
1. Health Check - Validates `/health` endpoint and WebSocket stats
2. Dashboard Accessibility - Confirms React app loads correctly
3. API Endpoint - Verifies `/api` endpoint with WebSocket info
4. WebSocket Connection - Tests WebSocket server connectivity
5. Bundle Size Check - Validates bundle structure
6. Security Headers - Confirms security headers (Helmet)
7. Performance Metrics (comprehensive mode only) - Lighthouse integration

**Exit Codes**:
- `0` - All tests passed
- `1` - One or more tests failed

**Example Output**:
```

npm run test:rate-limit:alpaca
```

---

## Deployment Workflow

### Pre-Deployment
1. **Local Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run build:dashboard
   npm start
   npm test
   ```

2. **Code Review**
   - All tests passing
   - No console errors
   - Performance validated

### Deployment
3. **Deploy to Railway**
   ```bash
   git push origin main  # Automatic Railway deployment
   # OR
   npm run deploy  # Manual Railway CLI deployment
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**
   ```bash
   railway logs --tail
   ```

### Post-Deployment
5. **Validate Deployment**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:validate
   ```

6. **Manual Verification**
   - Visit production URL
   - Test core functionality
   - Check browser DevTools for errors
   - Verify WebSocket connection

7. **Monitor Metrics**
   - Railway dashboard (CPU, memory, network)
   - WebSocket connection count
   - Error rates
   - User feedback

## Environment Variables

### Required for Validation Scripts

**DEPLOYMENT_URL** (optional)
- Default: `https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app`
- Description: Production deployment URL to validate
- Example: `DEPLOYMENT_URL=https://custom-url.com npm run deploy:validate`

**VALIDATION_MODE** (optional)
- Default: `quick`
- Options: `quick`, `comprehensive`
- Description: Validation thoroughness level
- Example: `VALIDATION_MODE=comprehensive npm run deploy:validate`

### Required for Production Deployment

See `.env.example` for complete list. Key variables:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=5000`
- `MONGODB_URI` - Database connection
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Discord bot authentication
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing

All configured in Railway environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

### Validation Script Fails

**Health check timeout**
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app/health

# Check Railway logs
railway logs --tail
```

**WebSocket connection fails**
```bash
# Test WebSocket manually
wscat -c wss://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app

# Check WebSocket server status
curl https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app/api | jq .endpoints.websocket
```

**Bundle size warnings**
- Rebuild dashboard: `npm run build:dashboard`
- Check dist/dashboard size: `du -sh dist/dashboard`
- Compare with baseline (1.1M)

### Deployment Issues

**Build fails on Railway**
```bash
# Verify local build works
npm run build:dashboard

# Check Railway build logs
railway logs --deployment <deployment-id>
```

**Health checks failing**
```bash
# Check server started successfully
railway logs --tail | grep "running on port"

# Verify health endpoint locally
npm start
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

**WebSocket not working in production**
1. Check Railway logs for WebSocket initialization
2. Verify CORS configuration (DASHBOARD_URL, FRONTEND_URL)
3. Test WebSocket connection with browser DevTools
4. Check for proxy/load balancer issues (Railway handles this)

---

## Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Railway logs
railway logs --tail

# Railway metrics (dashboard)
open https://railway.app/project/discord-trade-exec

# Health check (every 30s by Railway)
watch -n 30 'curl -s https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app/health | jq'
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Lighthouse audit
lighthouse https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app --view

# WebSocket stats
curl https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app/health | jq .websocket
```

### Error Monitoring
- Railway logs for server errors
- Browser DevTools console for client errors
- `/health` endpoint for WebSocket stats
- User feedback via support channels

## Best Practices

### Before Deployment
- ‚úÖ Run all tests locally
- ‚úÖ Build and test production bundle
- ‚úÖ Review code changes
- ‚úÖ Update documentation
- ‚úÖ Notify team of deployment window

### During Deployment
- ‚úÖ Monitor Railway deployment logs
- ‚úÖ Watch for build/start errors
- ‚úÖ Verify health checks pass
- ‚úÖ Run validation script immediately

### After Deployment
- ‚úÖ Validate functionality manually
- ‚úÖ Monitor for 15 minutes actively
- ‚úÖ Check error rates
- ‚úÖ Collect user feedback
- ‚úÖ Document any issues

### Rollback Plan
- ‚úÖ Know how to rollback (Railway dashboard)
- ‚úÖ Test rollback procedure in staging
- ‚úÖ Document rollback decision criteria
- ‚úÖ Communicate rollback to team
