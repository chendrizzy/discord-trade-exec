# Tasks: Discord Server Subscription/Membership Gating

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-subscription-gating/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/subscription-verification-api.md, quickstart.md

**TDD Requirements**: Per constitution Principle II, test-first development is **MANDATORY** for critical paths:
- Subscription verification logic (US2, US3)
- Access control enforcement (US2, US3, US5)
- Configuration persistence (US1, US4)

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Per plan.md structure:
- Models: `src/models/`
- Services: `src/services/subscription/`, `src/services/access-control/`, `src/services/setup-wizard/`
- Commands: `src/commands/setup/`, `src/commands/config/`
- Middleware: `src/middleware/`
- Events: `src/events/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ‚Üì
Phase 2 (Foundational) ‚Üê BLOCKS everything else
    ‚Üì
Phase 3-9 (User Stories) ‚Üê Can proceed in parallel after Phase 2
    ‚Üì
Phase 10 (Polish)
```

**CRITICAL**: Phase 2 (Foundational) MUST be 100% complete before any user story work begins.

### User Story Dependencies

```
Setup (Phase 1) ‚Üí Foundational (Phase 2) ‚Üí All User Stories Can Start
                                                    ‚Üì
                                    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

                            US6 (Analytics)
```

**Independence**: Each user story (US1-US6) can be implemented independently after Foundational phase completes.

### Within Each User Story

1. **Tests FIRST** (if TDD required) - must FAIL before implementation
2. Models (if needed for story)
3. Services
4. Commands/Middleware
5. Event handlers (if needed)
6. **Verify tests PASS**

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks can run in parallel (marked [P])

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T005-T007: Model tests in parallel
- T008-T010: Model implementations in parallel (after tests written)
- T012-T013: Provider tests in parallel
- T014-T015: Provider implementations in parallel
- T020-T021: Error handling and logging in parallel

**Phase 3+ (User Stories)**: 
- Once Phase 2 completes, ALL user stories can start in parallel if team capacity allows
- Within each story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

**Example: Parallel Team Execution After Foundational Phase**
```bash
Developer A: User Story 1 (Setup Wizard)
Developer B: User Story 2 (Subscriber Access)
Developer C: User Story 3 (Denial Handling)
Developer D: Real-Time Updates
```

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 (Foundational)

```bash
# Step 1: Write all model tests in parallel
Task T005: tests/unit/models/server-configuration.model.spec.ts
Task T006: tests/unit/models/user-access-status.model.spec.ts
Task T007: tests/unit/models/access-denial-event.model.spec.ts

# Step 2: Implement all models in parallel (after tests fail)
Task T008: src/models/server-configuration.model.ts
Task T009: src/models/user-access-status.model.ts
Task T010: src/models/access-denial-event.model.ts

# Step 3: Write provider tests in parallel
Task T012: tests/unit/services/subscription/discord-subscription-provider.spec.ts
Task T013: tests/unit/services/subscription/mock-subscription-provider.spec.ts

# Step 4: Implement providers in parallel
Task T014: src/services/subscription/discord-subscription-provider.ts
Task T015: src/services/subscription/mock-subscription-provider.ts
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Stories (After Phase 2)

```bash
# All can start simultaneously after Foundational phase:
Task T022-T029: User Story 1 (Setup)
Task T030-T039: User Story 2 (Allow)
Task T040-T048: User Story 3 (Deny)
Task T049-T053: Real-Time Updates (can overlap with US2/US3)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Critical P1 Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T021) ‚Üê **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T022-T029) ‚Üê Setup wizard
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T030-T039) ‚Üê Allow access
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T040-T048) ‚Üê Deny access
6. Complete Phase 6: Real-Time Updates (T049-T053)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test MVP independently
8. Deploy if ready (MVP = US1 + US2 + US3 + Real-time updates)

### Incremental Delivery

```
Foundation Ready (Phase 1 + 2)
    ‚Üì
+ US1 ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Setup wizard works)
    ‚Üì
+ US2 ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Subscribers can access)
    ‚Üì
+ US3 ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Non-subscribers blocked) ‚Üê MVP COMPLETE
    ‚Üì
+ Real-time ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Changes propagate)
    ‚Üì
+ US4 ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Reconfiguration works)
    ‚Üì
+ US5 ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Open access mode)
    ‚Üì
+ US6 ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Analytics available)
```

### Parallel Team Strategy (3+ Developers)

**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete (everyone works together)

**After Phase 2**:
- Developer 1: US1 (Setup Wizard) - Independent work
- Developer 2: US2 (Subscriber Access) - Independent work
- Developer 3: US3 (Denial Handling) - Independent work
- Developer 4: Real-Time Updates - Can start immediately after US2/US3 start

**Result**: 4x faster than sequential, each story independently testable

- **SC-011** (99.9% uptime): T047 (graceful degradation) + T076 (health checks)

## TDD Requirements Summary

Per constitution Principle II, the following tasks **REQUIRE** test-first development:

### MANDATORY TDD (Critical Paths):
- **T005-T010**: All model validation tests (subscription verification depends on correct data)
- **T012-T015**: Provider tests and implementation (core verification logic)
- **T016-T017**: Cache service tests (performance-critical path)
- **T018-T019**: Configuration service tests (persistence critical)
- **T030-T039**: Access control service tests (main gating logic - CRITICAL)
- **T040-T048**: Denial handling tests (access control enforcement - CRITICAL)
- **T054-T055**: Configuration update tests (data integrity critical)

### Acceptable Test-After:
- **T022-T023**: Setup wizard E2E (UI/UX, non-critical per constitution)
- **T062-T066**: Open access mode (simple bypass logic)
- **T067-T072**: Analytics (nice-to-have feature)
