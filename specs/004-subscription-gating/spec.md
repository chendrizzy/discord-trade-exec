# Feature Specification: Discord Server Subscription/Membership Gating

**Feature Branch**: `004-subscription-gating`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create an option/feature that allows community owners/server hosts to gate access to connection with their server's bot behind their own Discord server subscription/membership, which would be a selling point incentivizing community owners/server hosts to integrate the bot into their server to increase membership signups, while also being a selling point to community owners who prefer to create value for members/potential members by integrating the bot to be accessible for all community members. Does that make sense? Community owners/server hosts should be auto-prompted to select their preference for this during their initial set-up wizard/walkthrough, and it should obviously be configurable thereafter."

## Overview

This feature enables server owners to choose whether bot access requires Discord server subscription/membership or is available to all server members. This flexibility serves dual purposes: monetization incentive for subscription-based servers and community value creation for open-access servers. The configuration is prompted during initial bot setup and can be changed at any time.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Initial Bot Setup with Access Control Selection (Priority: P1)

A server owner installs the bot for the first time and is guided through a setup wizard that includes selecting their access control preference. This is the foundational user experience that determines how the bot operates in their server.

**Why this priority**: This is the core onboarding flow that every server owner must complete. Without this, there's no way to configure the feature at all. It establishes the default behavior and introduces server owners to the gating options.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the bot on a test server and verifying that the setup wizard appears with clear access control options. Delivers immediate value by allowing server owners to configure bot access according to their community model.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a server owner has just added the bot to their Discord server, **When** the bot is first authorized, **Then** a setup wizard is automatically triggered
2. **Given** the setup wizard is displayed, **When** the server owner reaches the access control step, **Then** they see two clearly labeled options: "Subscription/Membership Required" and "Open to All Members"
3. **Given** the server owner selects "Subscription/Membership Required", **When** they confirm their choice, **Then** the bot configuration is saved and only users with active subscriptions/memberships can use bot commands
4. **Given** the server owner selects "Open to All Members", **When** they confirm their choice, **Then** the bot configuration is saved and all server members can use bot commands
5. **Given** the setup wizard is in progress, **When** the server owner attempts to skip the access control step, **Then** they are informed this is a required configuration and cannot proceed without making a selection

### User Story 2 - Subscription Member Attempts Bot Access (Priority: P1)

A Discord user who has an active subscription/membership to the server attempts to use the bot in a server where gating is enabled. This validates the core gating mechanism works correctly for authorized users.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary success path for the gating feature. If subscription holders can't access the bot when they should be able to, the entire feature fails its purpose. This must work for the feature to deliver any value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a bot with subscription-gating enabled, then having a user with an active subscription attempt to use any bot command. Delivers value by confirming that paying/subscribed members receive their expected access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has an active subscription/membership to the server AND the bot has gating enabled, **When** the user sends a bot command, **Then** the bot processes the command normally
2. **Given** a subscribed user successfully uses the bot, **When** their subscription expires or is cancelled, **Then** the bot immediately stops responding to their commands
3. **Given** a user's subscription lapses, **When** they renew their subscription, **Then** the bot access is immediately restored without requiring any additional setup
4. **Given** a subscribed user is in a gated server, **When** they check their bot access status, **Then** they receive confirmation they have full bot access due to their subscription

### User Story 3 - Non-Subscriber Attempts Bot Access in Gated Server (Priority: P1)

A Discord user without a subscription/membership tries to use the bot in a server where access is gated. This validates that the gating mechanism properly restricts access and provides appropriate feedback.

**Why this priority**: Access control is worthless if it doesn't actually prevent unauthorized access. This is equally critical to P1 Story 2 - both the allow and deny paths must work correctly. This scenario also provides the conversion opportunity that incentivizes server owners to use gating.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a non-subscribed user attempt any bot command in a gated server. Delivers value by confirming the paywall works and provides information about how to gain access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user does NOT have an active subscription/membership AND the bot has gating enabled, **When** the user sends a bot command, **Then** the bot responds with a message explaining subscription is required
2. **Given** a non-subscribed user receives an access denial message, **When** they view the message, **Then** it includes clear information about how to subscribe/join to gain bot access
3. **Given** a non-subscribed user tries multiple commands, **When** each command is sent, **Then** they receive consistent access denial messages without the bot executing any commands
4. **Given** a server has gating enabled, **When** a non-subscribed user checks bot access requirements, **Then** they receive clear information about subscription requirements before attempting to use features

### User Story 4 - Server Owner Reconfigures Access Control (Priority: P2)

A server owner who previously configured the bot's access control wants to change their settings - either enabling gating after initially having open access, or removing gating after having it enabled.

**Why this priority**: Server owners' needs change over time. A server might start open and later add subscriptions, or vice versa. This flexibility is important for long-term adoption but not critical for initial launch since it can be set up correctly from the start.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the bot configuration after initial setup and toggling the access control setting. Delivers value by allowing server owners to adapt the bot to their evolving community model without reinstalling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a server owner has the bot installed, **When** they access bot settings/configuration, **Then** they can view and modify the current access control setting
2. **Given** the access control is currently set to "Open to All Members", **When** the server owner changes it to "Subscription/Membership Required", **Then** non-subscribed users immediately lose bot access
3. **Given** the access control is currently set to "Subscription/Membership Required", **When** the server owner changes it to "Open to All Members", **Then** all server members immediately gain bot access regardless of subscription status
4. **Given** a server owner is changing the access control setting, **When** they confirm the change, **Then** they receive a confirmation message explaining what just changed and who is now affected
5. **Given** a server owner modifies access control, **When** the change is saved, **Then** all existing bot interactions respect the new setting immediately without requiring bot restart or user re-authentication

---

### User Story 5 - User in Open-Access Server Uses Bot (Priority: P2)

A Discord user joins a server where the bot is configured for open access (no subscription required) and successfully uses bot features. This validates the non-gated flow works correctly.

**Why this priority**: This is important for servers that choose the open model, but since it's essentially the absence of restrictions, it's technically simpler and can be validated after the gating mechanism is working. The gating feature's value proposition doesn't depend on this working perfectly at launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a bot with open access and having any server member use commands. Delivers value by confirming the bot works normally when gating is disabled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a server has the bot configured for open access, **When** any member sends a bot command, **Then** the bot processes the command regardless of subscription status
2. **Given** a user is in an open-access server, **When** they check bot access requirements, **Then** they are informed that all server members can use the bot
3. **Given** an open-access server, **When** new members join, **Then** they have immediate bot access without any additional verification or setup

### User Story 6 - Server Owner Views Access Analytics (Priority: P3)

A server owner wants to understand how the gating feature is performing - how many non-subscribers have attempted access, how many subscribers are actively using the bot, and whether the gating is driving subscription conversions.

**Why this priority**: Analytics are valuable for optimization but not required for core functionality. Server owners can use the feature effectively without these insights. This can be added after the core access control mechanism is proven to work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating various access attempts and verifying that statistics are accurately captured and displayed. Delivers value by helping server owners make data-driven decisions about their access control strategy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a server owner has gating enabled, **When** they access bot analytics, **Then** they can see the number of access denial events in the past day/week/month
2. **Given** access analytics are displayed, **When** the server owner views the data, **Then** they see subscriber vs non-subscriber usage metrics
3. **Given** the bot has been running for some time, **When** the server owner views analytics, **Then** they can identify trends in access attempts and successful usage
4. **Given** multiple servers use the bot, **When** an individual server owner views analytics, **Then** they only see data for their specific server

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has a subscription but Discord's subscription API temporarily fails or is unavailable? System should default to allowing access for previously verified subscribers with cached subscription status, but log the verification failure for monitoring.

- What happens when a server owner changes access control while users are actively using the bot? Active sessions should complete their current operation, then respect the new access control on the next command.

- What happens when a user is subscribed to multiple tiers/roles in the server? If any of their active subscriptions/roles qualifies for bot access, they should have access. The system should check all applicable roles, not just the primary one.

- What happens if a server has no subscription system set up but enables "Subscription/Membership Required"? The bot should detect this configuration error during setup and either: (a) prevent enabling gating without a valid subscription system detected, or (b) warn the server owner that no users will have access until subscriptions are configured.

- What happens when Discord's role/permission system changes or a server restructures their subscription roles? The bot should provide a way for server owners to update which roles/subscriptions grant bot access without disabling and re-enabling gating.

- What happens if a user loses and regains their subscription multiple times in a short period? Each state change should be respected immediately, but the system should rate-limit subscription verification checks to avoid excessive API calls (e.g., cache subscription status for 60 seconds).

- What happens when a server owner deletes/removes the bot entirely? All configuration data for that server should be preserved for a reasonable period (e.g., 30 days) in case they re-install, then archived or deleted according to data retention policies.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST verify Discord server subscription/membership status before allowing bot command execution when gating is enabled

- **FR-002**: System MUST present server owners with a setup wizard upon first bot installation that includes access control configuration as a mandatory step

- **FR-003**: Server owners MUST be able to select between two access control modes: "Subscription/Membership Required" and "Open to All Members"

- **FR-004**: System MUST persist the server's access control configuration and apply it to all bot interactions for that server

- **FR-005**: System MUST immediately enforce access control changes when a server owner modifies their configuration

- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear feedback to users when their access is denied due to subscription requirements, including information on how to gain access

- **FR-007**: System MUST re-verify subscription status when a previously denied user attempts access again

- **FR-008**: System MUST allow server owners to modify their access control setting after initial setup through a bot configuration interface

- **FR-009**: System MUST handle subscription status changes (new subscriptions, cancellations, expirations) in real-time or near-real-time (within 60 seconds)

- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain separate access control configurations for each server where the bot is installed

- **FR-011**: Users MUST receive consistent access denial messages regardless of which bot command they attempt to use

- **FR-012**: System MUST validate during setup that enabling subscription gating is feasible (i.e., server has a detectable subscription system)

- **FR-013**: System MUST provide server owners with confirmation messages when access control settings are changed, explaining the immediate impact

- **FR-014**: System MUST cache subscription verification results for a reasonable period (suggested: 60 seconds) to minimize API calls while maintaining accuracy

- **FR-015**: System MUST allow bot commands to complete their current operation before applying new access control settings when configuration is changed mid-operation

### Key Entities

- **Server Configuration**: Represents the bot's settings for a specific Discord server, including the access control mode (gated or open), timestamp of last configuration change, and reference to which Discord subscription/role grants access (if gated)

- **Access Control Mode**: An enumeration representing the two states - "subscription_required" or "open_access" - that determines whether subscription verification is performed before command execution

- **User Access Status**: Represents a cached verification result for a specific user in a specific server, including subscription validity, last verification timestamp, and cached subscription details to minimize API calls

- **Access Denial Event**: Represents an instance when a non-subscribed user attempted to use the bot in a gated server, including timestamp, user identifier, command attempted, and whether subscription information was provided to the user

- **Subscription Verification**: Represents the process and result of checking a user's Discord subscription/membership status against the server's requirements, including API response, verification timestamp, and any errors encountered

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Server owners can complete the initial bot setup including access control selection in under 3 minutes

- **SC-002**: Subscription status verification for gated access completes in under 2 seconds for 95% of requests

- **SC-003**: Access control configuration changes take effect within 60 seconds for all users in the server

- **SC-004**: 100% of bot commands are successfully blocked for non-subscribers when gating is enabled

- **SC-005**: 100% of bot commands are successfully executed for subscribers when gating is enabled

- **SC-006**: Access denial messages include clear subscription information 100% of the time

- **SC-007**: Server owners can change their access control setting and receive confirmation in under 30 seconds

- **SC-008**: The system correctly handles subscription status changes (cancellations, renewals) within 60 seconds of Discord's notification

- **SC-009**: 90% of server owners who read the access denial message understand how to gain bot access without additional support

- **SC-010**: Zero unauthorized access events occur in gated servers (no false positives allowing non-subscribers)

- **SC-011**: The system maintains 99.9% uptime for subscription verification services, with graceful degradation to cached status during Discord API outages

## Assumptions

- Discord's subscription/role system provides a reliable API for verifying user membership status in real-time or near-real-time
- Server owners understand the concept of Discord server subscriptions/memberships and how they differ from general server membership
- The setup wizard interface can be delivered through Discord's native UI components (embeds, buttons, select menus)
- Subscription verification can be cached for up to 60 seconds without significant negative impact on user experience
- Most server owners will make a one-time access control decision during setup and rarely change it thereafter
- Discord provides webhook/event notifications for subscription status changes (joins, cancellations, expirations) rather than requiring constant polling
- Bot configuration interfaces can be accessed through Discord slash commands or a dedicated settings command

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this feature:

- Creating or managing Discord server subscriptions/memberships themselves (the bot uses existing Discord subscription systems)
- Payment processing or financial transactions related to subscriptions
- Multi-tier access control (e.g., different bot features for different subscription tiers) - this is binary access control only
- Temporary trial access for non-subscribers to preview bot features
- Analytics dashboard or detailed reporting on access attempts (noted as P3 user story for future consideration)
- Integration with third-party subscription/payment platforms outside Discord's native system
- Automated marketing or promotional messages to non-subscribers encouraging them to subscribe
- Custom access denial messages or branding per server (standardized messaging only)
- Grace periods for expired subscriptions before access is revoked
- Family/group subscription sharing (access is per individual Discord user account)
