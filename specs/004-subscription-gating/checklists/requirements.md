# Specification Quality Checklist: Discord Server Subscription/Membership Gating

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Specification is completely technology-agnostic. No mention of specific databases, frameworks, or implementation approaches.
- ✅ **User value focused**: All sections focus on what server owners and users need, not how the system will achieve it.
- ✅ **Non-technical writing**: Language is accessible to business stakeholders without technical expertise.
- ✅ **Complete sections**: Overview, User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, and Out of Scope all present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. Reasonable defaults were used for timing (60-second caching, 2-second verification) and behavior (graceful degradation during API failures).
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified through specific acceptance tests. For example, FR-004 (persist configuration) is tested by Story 4's scenarios where configuration changes persist.
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics:
  - SC-001: "under 3 minutes"
  - SC-002: "under 2 seconds for 95% of requests"
  - SC-004/005: "100% of bot commands"
  - SC-009: "90% of server owners"
  - SC-011: "99.9% uptime"
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No SC mentions implementation details. All focus on user-observable outcomes (completion time, accuracy, uptime).
- ✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each of 6 user stories has 3-5 Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy path, error cases, and edge conditions.
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 7 distinct edge cases covering API failures, concurrent operations, role changes, configuration errors, subscription fluctuations, and data retention.
- ✅ **Scope bounded**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 10 items that are NOT included, preventing scope creep.
- ✅ **Dependencies documented**: "Assumptions" section identifies 7 key assumptions about Discord's API capabilities, server owner knowledge, and system behavior.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: All 15 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories. For example:
  - FR-001 (verify subscription) → Story 2, Scenario 1
  - FR-002 (setup wizard) → Story 1, Scenarios 1-5
  - FR-006 (access denial feedback) → Story 3, Scenarios 2, 4
- ✅ **Primary flows covered**: Six prioritized user stories cover the complete feature lifecycle from initial setup (P1) through configuration changes (P2) to analytics (P3).
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes**: All 11 success criteria directly support the feature's dual value propositions (monetization incentive + community value).
- ✅ **No implementation leaks**: Verified through line-by-line review - no mentions of specific technologies, APIs, databases, or implementation patterns.

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All validation criteria pass. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Technology-agnostic and stakeholder-friendly
- Testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Properly scoped with explicit boundaries
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan
