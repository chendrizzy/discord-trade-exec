## Dependencies & Story Order

1. Foundational tasks (T008-T016) MUST complete before most US-* tasks that rely on encryption, audit logs, or config.
2. Authentication (T028-T031) should complete early—many stories (US-001, US-002, US-003) require authenticated user context.
3. Broker adapters (T023-T027) required before full trade submission (T018, T021).
4. WebSocket JWT auth (T038-T040) required for US-003 real-time flows before E2E tests.

## Parallel Execution Examples (per story)

- US-002 (Brokers): T024 (AlpacaAdapter) and T026 (ErrorMapper) are parallelizable; implement adapters for different brokers independently (mark as [P]).
- US-001 (TradeExecution): T018 (TradeExecutionService) and T019 (RiskManagementService) can be worked on in parallel across different engineers—both must integrate in T021.
- Frontend work (T047) can proceed in parallel with backend WebSocket handlers (T045/T046) once socket contracts are defined.

---

## Implementation Strategy

1. MVP-first: Implement US-001 (Automated Trade Execution) with a single broker (Alpaca) and paper trading accounts to demonstrate core value.
2. Test-First for critical paths: Implement tests for auth (T031), trade execution (T022), billing (T044) before production runs.
3. Iterative expansion: Add more brokers (US-002) after adapter pattern stable. Add analytics/social features as P2/P3.

## Notes

- All tasks follow the required checklist format and include file paths. Tasks are immediately actionable by an LLM or developer. If you want unit tests generated for each implementation task, say "TDD please" and I'll expand test tasks.
