```

### Vite Build Configuration
```javascript
// vite.config.js
{
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist/dashboard',
    emptyOutDir: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          // Automatic code splitting by Vite
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          charts: ['recharts'],
          websocket: ['socket.io-client']  // Already chunked
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Expected Bundle Size Change

**New Components Added**:
1. `TradeNotifications.jsx` - 2.80 kB (gzipped: 1.23 kB)
2. Enhanced `PortfolioOverview.jsx` - 8.54 kB (gzipped: 2.24 kB)
3. Enhanced `LiveWatchlist.jsx` - 4.51 kB (gzipped: 1.77 kB)
4. `WebSocketContext.jsx` - ~2 kB (gzipped: ~0.8 kB)
5. `useWebSocket.js` hook - ~8 kB (gzipped: ~2.5 kB)

**Dependencies (already in package.json)**:
- socket.io-client: 4.7.5 ✅ (no new dependency)
- @radix-ui/react-toast: 1.2.15 ✅ (already installed)

**Total Additional Size**: ~15 kB gzipped (~40 kB uncompressed)

**New Total Bundle Size**: ~1.12M (1.1% increase)

### Code Splitting Strategy

Vite automatically handles code splitting:
- **Route-based splitting**: Dashboard pages load independently
- **Component lazy loading**: Large components load on demand
- **Vendor chunking**: React, charts, and WebSocket libraries in separate chunks
- **CSS extraction**: Styles bundled separately (33 KB gzipped)

**Performance Impact**: Negligible
- Initial load: +15 KB gzipped (~150ms on 4G)
- Time to Interactive: No significant change expected
- First Contentful Paint: Unaffected

## Environment Variables

### Existing Variables (No Changes Required)
All required environment variables are already configured in Railway:

```bash
# Core Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DASHBOARD_URL=https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app

# Database & Sessions
MONGODB_URI=[configured]
SESSION_SECRET=[configured]
ENCRYPTION_KEY=[configured]

# Authentication
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=[configured]
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=[configured]
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=[configured]
DISCORD_CALLBACK_URL=[configured]

# Security
JWT_SECRET=[configured]
AWS_REGION=[configured]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[configured]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[configured]
AWS_KMS_CMK_ID=[configured]
```

### New Variables (Optional)
**None required** - WebSocket connections use the same origin by default.

However, for enhanced monitoring:
```bash
# Optional: Redis URL for WebSocket horizontal scaling
# Only needed if scaling beyond single instance
REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@redis-host:6379

# Optional: WebSocket-specific configuration
WS_PING_TIMEOUT=20000  # Default: 20s
WS_PING_INTERVAL=25000  # Default: 25s
```

**Recommendation**: Deploy without optional variables first. Add Redis scaling only if connection count exceeds 1,000 concurrent users.

---

## Deployment Steps

### Pre-Deployment Validation

1. **Local Build Test**
```bash
# Clean previous build
rm -rf dist/dashboard

# Build dashboard with new components
npm run build:dashboard

# Verify build output
ls -lah dist/dashboard/
# Expected: ~1.12M total, no build errors

# Test production build locally
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:5000 and verify:
# - Dashboard loads
# - WebSocket connects
# - No console errors
```

2. **Run Test Suite**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Expected: All tests passing
# - Unit tests: 175+ passing
# - Integration tests: 16+ passing
# - No regressions in existing functionality
```

### Deployment to Railway

**Method**: Git-based deployment (automatic on push to main)

```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes are committed
git status
# Should show clean working tree or only Week 3 Track B changes

# 2. Deploy to Railway
git push origin main
# Railway automatically detects push and triggers deployment

# Alternative: Manual deployment via Railway CLI
railway up
```

### Railway Build Process

Railway uses the configuration in `railway.toml`:

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[build.nixpacksPlan.phases.setup]
cmds = ["npm install"]

[build.nixpacksPlan.phases.build]
cmds = ["npm run build:dashboard"]

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[deploy.healthcheck]
path = "/health"
interval = 30
timeout = 10
```

**Build Steps**:
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install` (~2-3 min)
2. **Build dashboard**: `npm run build:dashboard` with Vite (~30s)
3. **Start server**: `npm start` (Express + WebSocket server)
4. **Health check**: Railway pings `/health` every 30s

**Deployment Timeline**:
- Build phase: ~3-4 minutes
- Deployment: ~30 seconds (zero-downtime rollout)
- Health check validation: 30 seconds
- **Total deployment time**: ~5 minutes

### Zero-Downtime Deployment

Railway automatically handles zero-downtime deployment:
1. New instance spins up with updated code
2. Health checks validate new instance
3. Traffic gradually shifts to new instance
4. Old instance drains connections and terminates

**WebSocket Connection Handling**:
- Existing WebSocket connections remain on old instance
- New connections route to new instance
- Old instance gracefully shuts down after 60s drain period
- Frontend auto-reconnects on disconnect (built into useWebSocket hook)

## Rollback Plan

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard Rollback (Recommended)
**Fastest method** - No command line required

1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Deployments
2. Find the last successful deployment (Track A)
3. Click "Redeploy" on the previous deployment
4. Railway automatically rolls back (5 minutes)

**When to use**: Any production issue requiring immediate rollback

### Option 2: Git Revert
**Permanent rollback** - For abandoning Track B deployment

```bash
# 1. Revert the commit
git log --oneline -5  # Find Track B commit hash
git revert <commit-hash>

# 2. Push to trigger redeployment
git push origin main

# 3. Railway automatically deploys reverted version
```

**When to use**: If Track B features need redesign or postponement

### Option 3: Feature Flag Disable
**Surgical rollback** - Disable WebSocket features without full rollback

Add feature flag to disable WebSocket in frontend:
```javascript
// src/dashboard/App.jsx
const ENABLE_WEBSOCKET = import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_WEBSOCKET !== 'false';

// Wrap WebSocketProvider with feature flag
{ENABLE_WEBSOCKET && (
  <WebSocketProvider sessionID={session.id} userId={user.id}>
    {/* ... */}
  </WebSocketProvider>
)}
```

Deploy with environment variable:
```bash
railway variables set VITE_ENABLE_WEBSOCKET=false
railway up
```

**When to use**: Testing rollback without affecting other Track B improvements

### Rollback Validation

After rollback:
- [ ] Dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Core functionality works (trading, portfolio, etc.)
- [ ] No WebSocket errors if WebSocket disabled
- [ ] User experience equivalent to Track A

### Rollback Communication

**User Notification** (if needed):
```
🔧 Maintenance Notice
We've temporarily rolled back our real-time updates feature while we
address some technical issues. Your trading functionality is unaffected.
We'll have the real-time features back soon!
```

## Monitoring Plan

### Real-Time Monitoring

**1. WebSocket Connection Metrics**

Track via `/health` endpoint and WebSocket server stats:
```javascript
// src/services/websocket/WebSocketServer.js
getStats() {
  return {
    connections: this.io.engine.clientsCount,
    totalConnections: this.totalConnectionsCounter,
    avgConnectionDuration: this.calculateAvgDuration(),
    reconnectRate: this.reconnectCounter / this.totalConnectionsCounter,
    messagesPerSecond: this.messageRate.getRate(),
    errorRate: this.errorCounter / this.messagesSent
  };
}
```

**Metrics to Track**:
- **Active Connections**: Current WebSocket connections
  - Target: Matches active user count
  - Alert: >1000 connections (may need Redis scaling)

- **Total Connections**: Cumulative connection count
  - Target: Grows with user base
  - Alert: Sudden spikes (may indicate DDoS or bot activity)

- **Connection Duration**: Average connection lifetime
  - Target: >5 minutes (users staying engaged)
  - Alert: <1 minute (connection instability)

- **Reconnect Rate**: Percentage of connections that reconnect
  - Target: <5% (stable connections)
  - Alert: >20% (network issues or server instability)

**2. Update Latency Metrics**

Measure time from server event to client update:
```javascript
// Frontend tracking
socket.on('portfolio:update', (data) => {
  const latency = Date.now() - data.timestamp;
  console.log(`Portfolio update latency: ${latency}ms`);
  // Send to analytics
  trackMetric('websocket.latency.portfolio', latency);
});
```

**Latency Targets**:
- **P50 Latency**: <100ms
- **P95 Latency**: <200ms
- **P99 Latency**: <500ms

**Alerts**:
- P95 > 500ms: Network congestion or server overload
- P99 > 1000ms: Critical performance degradation

**3. Error Rate Tracking**

Track WebSocket errors and failures:
```javascript
// Server-side error tracking
webSocketServer.on('error', (error) => {
  logger.error('WebSocket error:', error);
  errorCounter.increment('websocket.error', {
    type: error.type,
    code: error.code
  });
});
```

**Error Categories**:
- **Connection Errors**: Authentication failures, timeouts
- **Message Errors**: Invalid payload, rate limit exceeded
- **Server Errors**: Internal errors, database failures

**Error Rate Targets**:
- Overall error rate: <1%
- Authentication errors: <0.5%
- Message errors: <0.1%

**4. User Engagement Metrics**

Track real-time feature usage:
```javascript
// Analytics events
trackEvent('websocket.feature.used', {
  feature: 'portfolio_realtime',
  userId: user.id,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

**Engagement Metrics**:
- **WebSocket Adoption Rate**: % of users with active WebSocket connection
  - Target: >80% of logged-in users

- **Feature Usage**:
  - Portfolio real-time views: Track views with live updates
  - Trade notification interactions: Click-through rate
  - Watchlist real-time usage: Symbols watched in real-time

- **Time on Page**:
  - Before WebSocket: Baseline TBD
  - After WebSocket: Target +40% increase

### Monitoring Tools

**1. Railway Built-in Monitoring**
- **Deployment Logs**: Real-time logs of build and deployment
- **Application Logs**: Console output from Node.js server
- **Metrics Dashboard**: CPU, memory, network usage

Access: Railway Dashboard → Project → Deployments → Logs

**2. Custom Logging with Winston**
Already configured in the application:
```javascript
// src/utils/logger.js
const winston = require('winston');
logger.info('WebSocket connection established', { userId, socketId });
logger.error('WebSocket connection failed', { error, userId });
```

**Log Levels**:
- **ERROR**: Connection failures, unhandled errors
- **WARN**: High reconnection rate, rate limit hits
- **INFO**: New connections, disconnections, feature usage
- **DEBUG**: Detailed message logs (disabled in production)

**3. Health Check Monitoring**

Use external monitoring service (UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or StatusCake):

```bash
# Health check endpoint
GET https://discord-trade-exec-production.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "memory": { /* ... */ },

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks

**1. WebSocket Connection Failures**
- **Risk**: Users unable to establish WebSocket connection
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (core feature unavailable)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Fallback to polling if WebSocket fails
  - Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Clear error messages to users
  - Monitoring and alerting on connection failures
- **Rollback Plan**: Disable WebSocket via feature flag

**2. Performance Degradation**
- **Risk**: Real-time updates cause UI lag or increased latency

- **Mitigation**:
  - Proper cleanup in useWebSocket hook (useEffect cleanup)
  - Server-side connection tracking and cleanup
  - Memory monitoring and alerting
  - Load testing before deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Restart server + full rollback

**4. Browser Compatibility Issues**
- **Risk**: WebSocket not supported or broken on specific browsers
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium (subset of users affected)
- **Mitigation**:
  - socket.io handles fallback to polling automatically
  - Cross-browser testing before deployment
  - Browser detection and warnings
  - Graceful degradation without WebSocket
- **Rollback Plan**: Not required (feature gracefully degrades)

**5. High Connection Count**
- **Risk**: Unexpected traffic spike overwhelms WebSocket server
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: High (service outage)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Connection rate limiting (already implemented)
  - Redis adapter ready for horizontal scaling
  - Auto-scaling configured on Railway
  - Load testing with realistic traffic patterns
- **Rollback Plan**: Scale horizontally + enable Redis adapter

**6. Data Synchronization Issues**
- **Risk**: Real-time updates show stale or incorrect data
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (user trust degradation)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Server-side data validation before broadcast
  - Client-side timestamp checking
  - Periodic full refresh (every 5 minutes)
  - Monitoring for data discrepancies
- **Rollback Plan**: Full rollback to Track A
