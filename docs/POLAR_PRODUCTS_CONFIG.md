## Product UUID Placeholders

After creating products in Polar.sh, you'll need to copy the product UUIDs and store them for checkout session creation:

```bash
# .env configuration (update after product creation)
POLAR_PROFESSIONAL_MONTHLY_PRODUCT_ID=550e8400-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
POLAR_PROFESSIONAL_ANNUAL_PRODUCT_ID=550e8400-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
POLAR_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY_PRODUCT_ID=550e8400-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
POLAR_ENTERPRISE_ANNUAL_PRODUCT_ID=550e8400-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Implementation Notes

### Discord Integration
If using Discord invites as automated benefits:
1. Create permanent invite links in Discord (Settings → Invites → Create Invite → Never Expire)
2. Set up role hierarchy in Discord server
3. Configure Polar.sh Discord integration with bot permissions
4. Map Polar products → Discord roles in Polar dashboard

### Custom Benefits
The "Custom" benefit type requires webhook handling:
- Polar.sh sends `subscription.created` webhook
- Your backend updates Community document: `subscription.tier = 'professional'` or `'enterprise'`
- Frontend reads tier from database, not from Polar.sh directly

### Product Media Assets
Create these assets before setting up products:
- [ ] Professional tier dashboard screenshot (1200x630px)
- [ ] Enterprise tier dashboard screenshot (1200x630px)
- [ ] "Save 17%" badge overlay for annual plans
- [ ] Feature comparison graphics (optional)
