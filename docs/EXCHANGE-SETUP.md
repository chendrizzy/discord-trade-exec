# Crypto Exchange Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through connecting your crypto exchange accounts to the Discord Trade Executor. By connecting your exchanges, you can:

- ‚úÖ **Automate trade execution** from Discord signals
- ‚úÖ **Compare fees** across exchanges in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Execute trades** on the cheapest exchange automatically
- ‚úÖ **Track performance** across multiple exchanges

## üîí Security First

**CRITICAL SECURITY GUIDELINES:**

1. **Never share your API keys** - Treat them like passwords
2. **Use API key permissions** - Enable ONLY "Read" and "Trade" permissions
3. **NEVER enable withdrawal permissions** - This protects your funds
4. **Use IP whitelisting** - Restrict API access to your server IP (recommended)
5. **Enable 2FA** - Add extra security to your exchange account
6. **Store keys securely** - Keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM in our database
7. **Rotate keys regularly** - Create new keys every 90 days
8. **Use testnet first** - Test with sandbox/testnet before using real funds

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid API Key"

**Causes:**
- API key copied incorrectly (extra spaces)
- API key expired or deleted
- Wrong environment (production vs sandbox)

**Solutions:**
1. Re-copy the API key (ensure no leading/trailing spaces)
2. Verify the API key exists in your exchange settings
3. Double-check you're using the correct environment
4. Create a new API key if the old one was deleted

---

### Issue: "Insufficient Permissions"

**Causes:**
- API key doesn't have "Trade" permission
- API key only has "View" permission

**Solutions:**
1. Go to exchange API settings
2. Edit the API key permissions
3. Enable "Trade" permission
4. Re-connect in Discord Trade Executor

---

### Issue: "IP Not Whitelisted"

**Causes:**
- Your server IP is not in the API key's whitelist
- IP changed (dynamic IP)

**Solutions:**
1. Find your server's current public IP: `curl ifconfig.me`
2. Add the IP to exchange API whitelist
3. Re-test connection

---

### Issue: "Rate Limit Exceeded"

**Causes:**
- Too many API requests in short time
- Hitting exchange rate limits

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 60 seconds and retry
2. Reduce trading frequency
3. Enable caching in settings (if available)
4. Upgrade exchange API tier (if available)

---

### Issue: "Symbol Not Supported"

**Causes:**
- Trading pair not available on exchange
- Incorrect symbol format

**Solutions:**
1. Verify symbol format (use "BTC/USD" not "BTCUSD")
2. Check exchange website for supported pairs
3. Try alternative trading pair

---

### Issue: "Connection Timeout"

**Causes:**
- Network issues
- Exchange API downtime
- Firewall blocking requests

**Solutions:**
1. Check exchange status page
2. Verify your server can reach exchange API:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://api.pro.coinbase.com
   curl -I https://api.kraken.com
   ```
3. Check firewall rules
4. Contact exchange support if issue persists

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use the same API key for multiple bots?
**A:** Yes, but it's recommended to create separate API keys for each application for better security and tracking.

### Q: What happens if I enable withdrawal permissions?
**A:** **NEVER DO THIS.** If your API key is compromised, attackers can withdraw all your funds. We recommend withdrawal permissions are ALWAYS disabled.

### Q: Can I change API permissions after creation?
**A:** Yes, but you'll need to re-connect the exchange in Discord Trade Executor after changing permissions.

### Q: How often should I rotate API keys?
**A:** We recommend rotating API keys every 90 days or immediately if you suspect compromise.

### Q: Can I test without real money?
**A:** Yes! Use Coinbase Pro Sandbox or start with very small trade sizes on Kraken.

### Q: What happens if my exchange API key expires?
**A:** You'll receive an error notification. Simply create a new API key and re-connect.

### Q: Do API keys have expiration dates?
**A:** Coinbase Pro keys don't expire (unless deleted). Kraken keys are permanent until revoked.

### Q: Can I use multiple exchanges simultaneously?
**A:** Yes! Connect multiple exchanges and use fee comparison to execute on the cheapest one automatically.

### Q: What are the exchange rate limits?
**A:**
- **Coinbase Pro**: 10 requests/second
- **Kraken**: 15-20 requests/second (tier-dependent)

Our rate limiting automatically handles this for you.
