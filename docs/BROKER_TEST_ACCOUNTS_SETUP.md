## Environment Variables Setup

After getting credentials, update your `.env`:

```bash
# Development Environment
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/trade-executor-dev

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-this

# AWS KMS for Credential Encryption
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
KMS_KEY_ID=your-kms-key-id

# Optional: Skip encryption in development (NOT RECOMMENDED)
# SKIP_ENCRYPTION=true  # Only for local testing without AWS
```

---

## Testing Without AWS KMS (Local Development)

If you don't have AWS KMS set up yet, you can temporarily use local encryption:

```javascript
// src/config/index.js - Add this flag
module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  encryption: {
    enabled: process.env.SKIP_ENCRYPTION !== 'true',
    algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
    localKey: process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY || 'dev-only-key-DO-NOT-USE-IN-PROD'
  }
};
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This is only for local testing. NEVER use in production!

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid API Credentials"
**Solution:**
- Double-check API key copied correctly (no spaces)
- Verify API key has correct permissions
- For Coinbase Pro: check passphrase
- For IBKR: ensure Gateway is running

### Issue: "Connection Timeout"
**Solution:**
- For IBKR/Moomoo: verify desktop software running
- Check firewall settings
- Verify correct host/port

### Issue: "Encryption Failed"
**Solution:**
- Verify AWS KMS credentials in .env
- Check KMS key permissions
- Try SKIP_ENCRYPTION=true for local testing

### Issue: "Rate Limiting"
**Solution:**
- Wait 60 seconds between test connection attempts
- Don't spam the test button
- Rate limits: 10 requests per minute per broker

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Already in .gitignore
   .env
   .env.local
   credentials/
   ```

2. **Use paper/testnet first:**
   - Always test with paper trading
   - Verify everything works before using real accounts

3. **Limit API permissions:**
   - ‚ùå Never enable withdrawals
   - ‚úÖ Only enable read and trade permissions
   - üîê Use separate keys for testing vs production

4. **Rotate keys regularly:**
   - Regenerate API keys every 90 days
   - Delete unused API keys immediately

5. **Monitor usage:**
   - Check broker account for unexpected activity
   - Review API logs regularly

## Next Steps

After setting up test accounts:

1. ‚úÖ Update `.env` with credentials
2. ‚úÖ Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. ‚úÖ Open QA testing plan: `docs/QA_BROKER_TESTING_PLAN.md`
4. ‚úÖ Begin Scenario 1: First-Time Broker Connection
5. ‚úÖ Work through all 10 test scenarios
6. ‚úÖ Document any bugs found
7. ‚úÖ Mark Phase 3 as production-ready (if all tests pass)
