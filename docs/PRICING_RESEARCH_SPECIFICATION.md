# Pricing Research Specification

## Research Objective

Determine **optimal pricing strategy** that balances:
1. **User Value**: Competitive pricing that users are willing to pay
2. **Profitability**: 60%+ margin after all costs
3. **Conversion**: Free tier that drives paid upgrades
4. **Sustainability**: Costs that scale predictably with usage

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Cost Analysis (Infrastructure & API Costs)

#### 1.1 Broker API Costs
**Research Questions**:
- What is the cost per API call for each broker?
- Are there tiered pricing models (volume discounts)?
- Do costs differ by broker (Alpaca, Schwab, IBKR, etc.)?
- Are there monthly minimums or per-connection fees?

**Data Collection**:
```markdown
| Broker | Cost per Trade | Cost per Quote | Cost per Connection | Volume Discounts |

- Survey users on feature importance
- Calculate cost-to-deliver for each feature
- Determine ROI for each feature

**Feature Value Matrix**:

- Time to first upgrade (days)
- Features used before upgrade
- Upgrade triggers (hit limit, saw feature, etc.)

---

### Phase 5: LTV & Unit Economics

#### 5.1 Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
**Calculate LTV by Segment**:
```markdown
## Trader LTV (Professional)
- Average monthly revenue: $X
- Average retention months: Y
- Gross margin: Z%
- LTV = $X × Y × Z% = $___

## Community LTV (Professional)
- Average monthly revenue: $X
- Average retention months: Y
- Gross margin: Z%
- LTV = $X × Y × Z% = $___
```

**Data Needed**:
- Industry churn benchmarks (SaaS: 5-7%/mo)
- Trading platform retention data
- Competitor retention estimates

#### 5.2 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
**Estimate CAC**:
```markdown
## Organic Channels
- Content marketing: $X/user
- SEO: $X/user
- Community building: $X/user

## Paid Channels
- Google Ads: $X/user
- Social media ads: $X/user
- Influencer partnerships: $X/user

Target: LTV/CAC ratio > 3:1
```

#### 5.3 Payback Period
**Calculate**:
```markdown
Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin)

Target: < 12 months
```

---

### Phase 6: Metered Pricing Strategy

#### 6.1 Overage Rate Calculation
**Cost-Plus Model**:
```markdown
Cost per Signal:
  - Broker API call: $0.001
  - Infrastructure (compute): $0.0003
  - Infrastructure (DB write): $0.0002
  - Bandwidth: $0.0001
  - Support overhead: $0.0004
  **Total Cost**: $0.0020/signal

Markup Options:
  - 2x markup: $0.004/signal
  - 3x markup: $0.006/signal
  - 5x markup: $0.010/signal

Recommended: 3x markup = $0.006/signal ($6 per 1,000 signals)
```

#### 6.2 Overage Pricing Psychology
**Research**:
- AWS overage pricing models
- Twilio/SendGrid overage rates
- User perception of fair overage rates
- Notification strategy for approaching limits

---

### Phase 7: Free Tier Optimization

#### 7.1 Free Tier Goals
1. **Activation**: Get users to first successful signal execution
2. **Habit Formation**: Use product 3+ times/week
3. **Upgrade Triggers**: Hit limits within 30 days (for motivated users)
4. **Cost Control**: Free users cost < $1/mo to serve

#### 7.2 Free Tier Limit Scenarios

**Conservative (Cost-Focused)**:
```markdown
Community Free Tier:
- 5 members max
- 1 signal provider
- 20 signals/day

Trader Free Tier:
- 3 signals/day
- 1 broker connection
- Basic analytics only

Estimated Cost: $0.50/user/mo
Estimated Conversion: 15%
```

**Moderate (Balanced)**:
```markdown
Community Free Tier:
- 10 members max
- 2 signal providers
- 50 signals/day

Trader Free Tier:
- 5 signals/day
- 1 broker connection
- Basic analytics

Estimated Cost: $1.20/user/mo
Estimated Conversion: 8%
```

**Generous (Growth-Focused)**:
```markdown
Community Free Tier:
- 20 members max
- 3 signal providers
- 100 signals/day

Trader Free Tier:
- 10 signals/day
- 2 broker connections
- Advanced analytics

Estimated Cost: $2.50/user/mo
Estimated Conversion: 4%
```

**Optimization Question**: Which scenario maximizes `(Paid Conversions × LTV) - (Free User Costs)`?
