# Comprehensive Spec Creation - Action Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Goal**: Create detailed, constitutional, multi-faceted project specification before implementation
**Timeline**: 2-3 days for spec creation, then review before implementation

---

## Phase 1: Preparation (Complete ✅)

### 1.1 Foundation Documents Created
- [x] Constitution v1.0.0 ratified (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
- [x] OpenSpec ↔ Speckit sync strategy defined (`.specify/OPENSPEC_SYNC_STRATEGY.md`)
- [x] Constitution compliance audit complete (`.specify/CONSTITUTION_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md`)

### 1.2 Current State Analysis
- [x] 20+ OpenSpec proposals inventoried
- [x] Existing spec.md analyzed (001-openspec-to-speckit-migration)
- [x] Compliance gaps identified (62/100 score, 4 deployment blockers)
- [x] Completion percentages audited (need recalculation with quality gates)

### 2.2 Comprehensive Spec Inputs

**Context for `/speckit.specify`**:

```
Create comprehensive product specification for Discord Trade Executor SaaS platform.

**Project Overview**:
- Automated trading bot SaaS for Discord communities
- Multi-broker support (stocks: Alpaca/IBKR/Schwab, crypto: Coinbase/Kraken/Binance)
- Real-time portfolio updates via WebSocket
- Subscription tiers: Basic ($49/mo), Pro ($99/mo), Premium ($299/mo)
- Target: 10K+ users, $500K+ ARR

**Current State**:
- 20+ active OpenSpec proposals (45% overall completion)
- Core trading operational (signal parsing, execution, risk management)
- 5 broker adapters complete (IBKR, Schwab, Alpaca, Coinbase, Kraken)
- Polymarket intelligence live (whale detection, anomaly analysis)
- WebSocket infrastructure started (6.8% complete)
- Analytics platform partial (69.4% complete)

**Critical Requirements**:
1. Must align with Constitution v1.0.0 (7 core principles)
2. Security-first: OWASP Top 10 compliance, AES-256-GCM encryption
3. Test-first for critical paths: trading, security, billing
4. Broker adapter pattern: standardized abstraction for all brokers
5. Provider abstraction: billing (Polar/Stripe), auth (Discord OAuth2)
6. Real-time standards: Socket.IO + Redis, JWT auth, room isolation
7. Observability: Winston logging, audit trails, health checks

**Deployment Blockers** (Must resolve before production):
- OWASP Top 10 security audit (not scheduled)
- Test-first implementation for OAuth2 token refresh (39.9% complete)
- JWT authentication for WebSockets (not implemented)
- Immutable audit logs for financial operations (not implemented)

**Read These Documents**:
- openspec/project.md (tech stack, conventions)
- .specify/memory/constitution.md (principles)
- .specify/CONSTITUTION_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md (compliance gaps)
- All OpenSpec proposals in openspec/changes/ (implementation status)
- README.md, SECURITY.md, AGENTS.md (project context)
- docs/BROKER-SETUP.md, docs/billing/*, docs/WEBSOCKET-GUIDE.md (architecture)

**Spec Requirements**:
1. User stories prioritized by constitution principles (security, testing, observability)
2. Functional requirements mapped to OpenSpec proposals (no duplication)
3. Success criteria with measurable outcomes (performance, business, reliability)
4. Constitution compliance section for each requirement
5. Quality gates defined (code + tests + docs + deployed = 100%)
6. Deployment blockers explicitly called out
7. Phase organization aligned with OpenSpec proposal dependencies
8. Edge case scenarios for error handling (Principle VII)
9. Test-first requirements for critical paths (Principle II)
10. Security requirements with acceptance scenarios (Principle I)

**Output**: Single comprehensive spec.md consolidating all OpenSpec work with constitutional alignment.
```

### 2.3 Spec Creation Command

**Run after reading all documents**:

```bash
/speckit.specify [Use context above + read all referenced documents]
```

**Expected Output**:
- `specs/000-discord-trade-executor-main/spec.md` (comprehensive product spec)
- User stories organized by constitutional principles
- Requirements mapped to existing OpenSpec proposals
- Acceptance scenarios for all security/testing/observability requirements
- Deployment readiness checklist

---

## Phase 3: Plan & Tasks Generation

### 3.1 Generate Implementation Plan

**Run after spec approved**:

```bash
/speckit.plan
```

**Expected Output**:
- `specs/000-discord-trade-executor-main/plan.md`
- Constitution compliance check for all 7 principles
- Technical context (Node.js, React, MongoDB, Railway)
- Project structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
- Complexity justification (if any violations)
- Phase dependencies mapped to OpenSpec proposals

### 3.2 Generate Task Breakdown

**Run after plan approved**:

```bash
/speckit.tasks
```

**Expected Output**:
- `specs/000-discord-trade-executor-main/tasks.md`
- Tasks organized by user story (independent implementation)
- Test tasks FIRST for critical paths (Principle II compliance)
- Parallel tasks marked `[P]`
- Dependencies documented
- Phases aligned with OpenSpec proposals

---

## Phase 4: Validation & Sync

### 4.1 Run Comprehensive Analysis

**Run after tasks.md created**:

```bash
/speckit.analyze
```

**Expected Output**:
- Analysis report with findings table
- Coverage summary (requirements → tasks mapping)
- Constitution alignment verification
- Ambiguity/duplication detection
- Recommendations for remediation

### 4.2 Sync to OpenSpec

**Manual Process** (until automation available):

1. **Map Speckit → OpenSpec**:
   ```bash
   # For each user story in spec.md:
   # - Identify corresponding OpenSpec proposal
   # - Update proposal with constitution compliance section
   # - Add test-first tasks if missing
   # - Recalculate completion percentage
   ```

2. **Create Missing Proposals**:
   ```bash
   # Based on deployment blockers:
   mkdir -p openspec/changes/implement-security-audit
   mkdir -p openspec/changes/implement-audit-logging
   mkdir -p openspec/changes/implement-jwt-websocket-auth
   # Add proposal.md, tasks.md, design.md
   ```

3. **Update Completion Tracking**:
   ```bash
   # Apply quality gate formula:
   # - Code only = 60% max
   # - Code + Tests = 80% max
   # - Code + Tests + Docs = 90% max
   # - Code + Tests + Docs + Deployed = 100%
   
   # Update spec.md status table with new percentages
   ```
