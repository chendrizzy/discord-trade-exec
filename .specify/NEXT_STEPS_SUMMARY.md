## Critical Issues to Resolve

### Deployment Blockers üî¥

**Cannot deploy to production until resolved:**

1. **OWASP Top 10 Security Audit**
   - Action: Create `openspec/changes/implement-security-audit/` proposal
   - Timeline: Schedule before launch
   - Owner: Security team / External firm

2. **Test-First Implementation**
   - Action: Add test-first tasks to OAuth2, billing proposals
   - Timeline: Before merging new critical path code
   - Owner: Engineering team

3. **JWT WebSocket Authentication**
   - Action: Add JWT auth tasks to `implement-realtime-infrastructure`
   - Timeline: Before WebSocket production launch
   - Owner: Backend team

4. **Immutable Audit Logs**
   - Action: Create `openspec/changes/implement-audit-logging/` proposal
   - Timeline: Before production launch (financial compliance)
   - Owner: Backend team

### High Priority Issues üü°

5. **Completion Percentage Recalculation**
   - dual-dashboard: 90% ‚Üí ~45% (scaffolded only)
   - broker-integrations: 88.6% accurate if deployment = 10% weight
   - Action: Apply quality gate formula to all proposals

6. **Missing OpenSpec Proposals**
   - Payment processing (FR-046 to FR-050) - No proposal exists
   - Security hardening (FR-051 to FR-055) - No proposal exists
   - Action: Create proposals or document as out-of-scope

7. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - User messages inconsistent across endpoints
   - HTTP status codes not standardized
   - Action: Create error message guide, audit endpoints

## Your Questions Answered

### 1. Consolidation/Tracking Strategy ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Consolidation with one-way sync (OpenSpec ‚Üí Speckit)

**Implementation**:
- **OpenSpec**: Source of truth for implementation (tasks, design, technical details)
- **Speckit**: Consolidated product view (user stories, requirements, business tracking)
- **Sync**: Manual initially, automated later (see OPENSPEC_SYNC_STRATEGY.md)
- **Benefit**: Update OpenSpec task completion ‚Üí Auto-sync to Speckit status

### 2. Compliance Auditing ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Audit existing work, bring up-to-date

**Results**:
- Pre-constitution work (broker adapters, encryption): **Grandfathered** with exceptions documented
- Incomplete work (OAuth2, WebSocket, billing): **Must comply** going forward
- New work (security audit, audit logs): **Must comply** before deployment

**Actions**:
- Add constitution compliance section to all proposals
- Require TDD for new critical path code
- Schedule security audit before production

### 3. Completion Definition ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Code + Tests + Docs + Deployed = 100%

**Formula**:
```
Base % = (Checked Tasks / Total Tasks) √ó 100

Quality Gates:
- Code only ‚Üí 60% max
- Code + Tests ‚Üí 80% max
- Code + Tests + Docs ‚Üí 90% max
- Code + Tests + Docs + Deployed ‚Üí 100%

Special Cases:
- Scaffolded (UI without data) ‚Üí 25% max
```

**Impact**:
- broker-integrations: 88.6% accurate (deployment pending = 90% max)
- dual-dashboard: 90% ‚Üí 45% (scaffolded only)
- realtime-infrastructure: 6.8% accurate (early stage)

### 4. Scope Clarity ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Include payment + security in comprehensive spec

**Rationale**:
- Payment processing (FR-046 to FR-050) mentioned in spec but no OpenSpec proposal
- Security hardening (FR-051 to FR-055) mentioned but no proposal
- Constitution requires OWASP audit + audit logging (new requirements)

**Action**: Comprehensive spec will clarify scope and create missing proposals

### 5. Timeline: ASAP with Quality ‚úÖ

**Approach**: Phased execution with quality gates

**Timeline**:
- **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Foundation documents (constitution, sync, audit)
- **Phase 2 (1-2 days)**: Comprehensive spec creation with `/speckit.specify`
- **Phase 3 (4-8 hours)**: Plan and tasks generation
- **Phase 4 (4-6 hours)**: Validation and OpenSpec sync
- **Phase 5 (1-2 weeks)**: Resolve deployment blockers (security, tests, auth, logs)
- **Phase 6 (TBD)**: Implementation with `/speckit.implement`

**Total Time to Implementation**: 2-3 weeks (includes blocker resolution)

**Quality Assurance**:
- Constitution compliance checks at every phase
- Test-first gates for critical paths
- Security review before deployment
- Performance benchmarks validated

## Next Steps (What You Should Do)

### Immediate: Read Documentation (2-3 hours)

**Priority 1 - Foundation**:
1. `openspec/project.md` - Tech stack, conventions, patterns
2. `README.md` - Project overview and features
3. `AGENTS.md` - Repository guidelines
4. `SECURITY.md` - Security implementation
5. `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

**Priority 2 - Architecture**:
6. `docs/BROKER-SETUP.md` - Broker integration architecture
7. `docs/billing/BILLING_PROVIDER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Billing abstraction
8. `docs/WEBSOCKET-GUIDE.md` - Real-time infrastructure
9. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment procedures

**Priority 3 - OpenSpec Proposals** (Read tasks.md and design.md):
10. `implement-broker-integrations` (88.6%)
11. `implement-dual-dashboard-system` (45%)
12. `implement-unified-oauth2-authentication` (39.9%)
13. `implement-realtime-infrastructure` (6.8%)
14. `implement-analytics-platform` (69.4%)
15. `implement-crypto-exchanges` (68.75%)

### After Reading: Create Comprehensive Spec

**Command**:
```
/speckit.specify

Create comprehensive product specification for Discord Trade Executor SaaS.

Reference all documents read above, consolidate 20+ OpenSpec proposals, align with Constitution v1.0.0.

Requirements:
- User stories prioritized by constitutional principles
- Functional requirements mapped to OpenSpec proposals (avoid duplication)
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Constitution compliance section per requirement
- Quality gates defined (Code + Tests + Docs + Deployed = 100%)
- Deployment blockers explicitly documented
- Test-first requirements for critical paths
- Security requirements with acceptance scenarios

Output: specs/000-discord-trade-executor-main/spec.md
```

### After Spec Approved: Generate Plan & Tasks

```bash
# Generate implementation plan
/speckit.plan

# Generate task breakdown
/speckit.tasks

# Validate everything
/speckit.analyze
```

### After Analysis Passes: Create Blocker Proposals

**Create these OpenSpec proposals**:
1. `openspec/changes/implement-security-audit/`
2. `openspec/changes/implement-audit-logging/`
3. `openspec/changes/implement-jwt-websocket-auth/`

### Finally: Begin Implementation

```bash
/speckit.implement
```

## Key Takeaways

### ‚úÖ Achievements
- Constitution ratified with 7 clear principles
- Sync strategy defined (OpenSpec ‚Üí Speckit)
- Compliance audit complete (identified 4 deployment blockers)
- Action plan created with timeline

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
- **DO NOT** deploy to production until blockers resolved
- **DO NOT** implement without comprehensive spec approved
- **DO NOT** skip test-first for critical paths going forward
- **DO NOT** assume "scaffolded" = "complete"

### üéØ Goals
- Create single comprehensive spec consolidating all work
- Align OpenSpec proposals with constitution
- Resolve deployment blockers (security, testing, auth, logs)
- Implement with confidence and quality

### üìä Metrics
- Current compliance: 62/100 (needs improvement)
- Deployment blockers: 4 critical issues
- Active proposals: 6 (45% average completion)
- Timeline to implementation: 2-3 weeks
