## Next Steps (As Per Speckit Workflow)

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review Specification** (Now)
   - User reviews `specs/003-discord-trade-executor-main/spec.md`
   - Validates 13 user stories align with product vision
   - Confirms 90 requirements capture all necessary functionality
   - Verifies 25 success criteria match business objectives

2. **Generate Implementation Plan** (Next)
   ```bash
   /speckit.plan
   ```
   - Creates `specs/003-discord-trade-executor-main/plan.md`
   - Includes constitutional compliance checks
   - Technical context (Node.js, MongoDB, WebSocket architecture)
   - Project structure analysis
   - Timeline estimation with critical path analysis

3. **Generate Task Breakdown** (After Plan)
   ```bash
   /speckit.tasks
   ```
   - Creates `specs/003-discord-trade-executor-main/tasks.md`
   - Breaks down 13 user stories into actionable tasks
   - Organized by user story with test-first gates for critical paths
   - Parallel tasks marked [P] for concurrent execution
   - Dependencies documented between tasks

4. **Validate Before Implementation** (After Tasks)
   ```bash
   /speckit.analyze
   ```
   - Validates plan.md and tasks.md exist
   - Checks constitutional compliance
   - Verifies no conflicts with OpenSpec proposals
   - Ensures deployment blockers addressed in task sequence

5. **Execute Implementation** (After Validation)
   ```bash
   /speckit.implement
   ```
   - Execution order (per action plan):
     1. Resolve 4 deployment blockers (US-009, US-007, US-008, then US-004/US-012 test coverage)
     2. Complete OAuth2 token refresh (39.9% → 100%)
     3. Complete realtime infrastructure (6.8% → 100%)
     4. Deploy broker integrations (88.6% → 100%)
     5. Integrate dual dashboard data (45% → 100%)
     6. Launch to production with monitoring

### Execution Timeline (Estimated)

- **Phase 2 (Spec Creation)**: ✅ COMPLETE (this phase - 1 day)
- **Phase 3 (Plan & Tasks)**: ⏳ 4-8 hours
- **Phase 4 (Validation & Sync)**: ⏳ 4-6 hours
- **Phase 5 (Blocker Resolution)**: ⏳ 1-2 weeks (OWASP audit, test coverage, audit logs, WebSocket auth)
- **Phase 6 (Implementation)**: ⏳ 2-3 weeks (remaining features per task breakdown)

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 3-5 weeks from now to production deployment

## Important Notes

### OpenSpec Consolidation
- This spec consolidates 20+ OpenSpec proposals from `openspec/changes/` directory
- OpenSpec remains source of truth for implementation details (per sync strategy)
- Speckit spec provides consolidated view for planning and execution
- Completion percentages recalculated using quality gates formula: Code (60%) + Tests (80%) + Docs (90%) + Deployed (100%)

### Constitutional Requirements
- All development must comply with Constitution v1.0.0 (ratified 2025-10-21)
- 2 NON-NEGOTIABLE principles: Security-First (I) and Test-First (II)
- Production deployment BLOCKED until 4 deployment blockers resolved
- Pre-constitution work grandfathered with documented exceptions

### Technology Justifications
- Technology specifics in requirements (Socket.IO, AES-256-GCM, CCXT) justified by:
  - Constitutional Principle I (Security-First requires specific cryptographic standards)
  - Constitutional Principle IV (Real-Time Standards require WebSocket implementation)
  - Industry standards (OWASP compliance requires specific security measures)

### Scope Management
- 10 features explicitly OUT OF SCOPE (mobile apps, options trading, tax reporting, etc.)
- No scope creep tolerated during implementation phase
- Future features require separate OpenSpec proposals and constitutional compliance review

## Questions for User Before Proceeding

1. **User Story Priority Validation**: Do the P1/P2/P3 assignments align with your product vision? Any stories need priority adjustment?

2. **Success Criteria Agreement**: Do the 25 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-025) match your definition of "done" for production launch?

3. **Out of Scope Confirmation**: Are you comfortable deferring the 10 listed features (mobile apps, options trading, etc.) to future phases?

4. **Deployment Blocker Timeline**: The 4 deployment blockers (security audit, test compliance, WebSocket auth, audit logs) add 1-2 weeks to timeline. Acceptable?

5. **Execution Priority**: Shall we proceed with `/speckit.plan` generation next, or do you want to review/adjust the specification first?
