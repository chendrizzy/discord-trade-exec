## Conclusion

The platform has **4 production-ready features** with combined **$82K annual revenue potential**.

**Critical Path**:
1. **Weeks 1-4**: Deploy broker integrations + crypto exchanges ($82K revenue)
2. **Weeks 5-7**: Build real-time infrastructure (enables future features)
3. **Week 8+**: Complete analytics platform + social trading ($50K+ revenue)

**Total Projected Revenue (6 months)**: $130K+ annual

The deployment automation created today provides a clear path to execute the broker integrations rollout over the next 4 weeks. Running crypto exchanges deployment in parallel maximizes velocity while both features are staging/beta tested.

Real-time infrastructure is the critical next build after deployments complete, as it unblocks both advanced analytics and social trading features.
