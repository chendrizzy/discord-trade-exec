## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions Made

1. **MVP-First Approach**: Focused on core foundation (data models, services, API) before UI and advanced features
   - Rationale: Validate analytics calculations and data structure before building complex UI

2. **Rule-Based Churn Prediction**: Started with weighted rule-based scoring instead of ML models
   - Rationale: Simpler to implement, explain, and tune; provides immediate value
   - Future: Can be replaced with ML model once sufficient training data is collected

3. **Default Tier Pricing in Code**: Hardcoded tier prices in RevenueMetrics constructor
   - Rationale: Quick MVP implementation
   - Future: Move to configuration or database table for dynamic pricing

4. **Admin-Only Access**: All analytics endpoints require admin role
   - Rationale: Sensitive business metrics should be restricted
   - Future: Add granular permissions for different metric types

5. **Event Tracking Not Yet Integrated**: AnalyticsEvent model created but not yet emitting events
   - Rationale: Foundation must be tested before adding event tracking throughout codebase
   - Next Step: Phase 4 will integrate event tracking at all relevant points

### Known Limitations

1. **No Historical Data**: Cohort analysis requires users with `createdAt` timestamps
2. **Basic Retention Recommendations**: Currently using simple if/else logic; could be more sophisticated
3. **No A/B Testing**: Cohort comparison exists but not integrated with experiment frameworks
4. **Manual Event Tracking**: Developers must remember to emit AnalyticsEvent at appropriate points
5. **No Data Validation**: Event data is schema-less (Mixed type); could lead to inconsistent data

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all calculation methods ✅ COMPLETE
  - 95 comprehensive tests across all four analytics services
  - 100% pass rate with timezone-safe date handling
  - Edge cases, error scenarios, and large dataset handling covered
  - Event tracking service fully tested with batching, validation, and shutdown logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints ✅ COMPLETE
  - 27 comprehensive tests for all 11 endpoints
  - Authentication/authorization, query validation, error handling
  - Response format consistency verified
  - Performance testing included
  - Advanced mocking strategy using shared mock instances
- Performance tests for cohort analysis with large datasets (NOT STARTED)
- Manual validation against spreadsheet calculations for revenue metrics ✅ VALIDATED

**Test Implementation Highlights**:
- Used Jest mocking strategy with spies on Mongoose models and services
- Applied timezone-safe date handling with midday timestamps
- Used `toBeCloseTo()` for floating-point calculations
- Comprehensive risk scoring validation with exact point calculations
- Trend detection algorithm validated with multiple scenarios
- Integration tests use supertest with proper Express app setup
- All endpoints tested for success paths, error paths, and edge cases
- **Advanced Integration Test Pattern**: Solved singleton + mock timing issues through:
  - Extracting mock instance objects outside jest.mock() calls
  - Using mockReturnValue() to share instances between routes and tests
  - Modifying methods on existing instances rather than creating new objects
  - Proper beforeEach cleanup of event buffers and shutdown flags

### Success Criteria (from proposal.md)

- [x] Cohort retention table tracks 12+ months ✅
- [ ] Churn prediction accuracy >75% (requires historical data to validate)
- [x] MRR, ARR, LTV calculated and exposed via API ✅
- [x] Admin dashboard displays all key metrics ✅
  - Business Analytics dashboard with MRR/ARR/LTV/Churn Rate
  - Revenue breakdown by tier
  - Churn risk overview with at-risk user table
  - Cohort retention heat map
- [ ] Automated retention emails sent to at-risk users (not yet implemented)
