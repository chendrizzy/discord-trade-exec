### Critical Gaps Identified

| Category | Status | Priority | Business Impact |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Multi-Broker Support** | ‚ùå Missing IBKR, Schwab | P0 | Premium tier broken |
| **Real-time Updates** | ‚ùå No WebSocket | P0 | Poor UX, manual refresh |
| **Crypto Exchanges** | üü° Binance only | P1 | Limited crypto TAM |
| **Analytics Platform** | ‚ùå No cohort/churn data | P1 | No data-driven decisions |
| **Social Trading** | ‚ùå Not implemented | P2 | Missing network effects |

## üöÄ Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: P0 Features (4-6 weeks)
**Execute in Parallel**:
1. Real-time Infrastructure (2-3 weeks) - Foundation for everything
2. Broker Integrations (4-6 weeks) - Premium tier requirement

**Why Parallel**: No technical dependencies between these features

### Phase 2: P1 Features (5-7 weeks)
**Execute in Parallel**:
1. Crypto Exchanges (2-3 weeks) - Quick win
2. Analytics Platform (3-4 weeks) - Enables data-driven optimization

**Dependency**: Real-time infrastructure provides WebSocket for live metrics

### Phase 3: P2 Features (6-8 weeks)
**Execute Sequential**:
1. Social Trading (6-8 weeks) - Complex, requires all previous features

**Dependencies**: Requires brokers, real-time, and analytics to be complete
