# Add Full Moomoo Connection Support

## Metadata
- **Change ID**: `add-moomoo-ui-support`
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Created**: 2025-10-16
- **Completed**: 2025-10-16
- **Author**: Claude
- **Type**: Feature Enhancement

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
Moomoo broker adapter is fully implemented with 16/16 methods and 30/30 passing tests, but users cannot configure Moomoo connections through the UI because:
1. Moomoo is not exposed in `/api/brokers` endpoint
2. UI BrokerConfigWizard doesn't support Moomoo-specific credential fields (Account ID, Password, Host, Port)
3. No user guidance for OpenD Gateway prerequisite
4. No handling of "requiresOpenDRunning" flag in UI

**Impact:**
- Users cannot leverage Moomoo's commission-free stock trading
- Backend integration is complete but inaccessible to end users
- Missing a key differentiator vs competitors (Moomoo OpenAPI integration is uncommon)

## Proposed Solution

Add complete UI and API support for Moomoo broker configuration:

###1. API Endpoints
- Expose Moomoo in `GET /api/brokers` response
- Return Moomoo-specific metadata in `GET /api/brokers/moomoo`
- Support Moomoo credential structure in `POST /api/brokers/configure`
- Handle Moomoo testing in `POST /api/brokers/test`

### 2. UI Enhancement
- Extend BrokerConfigWizard to support custom credential fields per broker
- Add Moomoo-specific form fields: Account ID, Password, Host (default: 127.0.0.1), Port (default: 11111)
- Display OpenD Gateway prerequisite warning with setup link
- Handle testnet/live environment selection

### 3. User Guidance
- Add in-wizard documentation about OpenD Gateway requirement
- Link to setup guide (`docs/MOOMOO_OPEND_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)
- Display prerequisite warnings before credential entry

## User Value

**For Traders:**
- Access to commission-free stock trading via Moomoo
- Paper trading support for risk-free testing
- Support for US, HK, CN, SG, JP markets
- Advanced order types (stop-loss, trailing stop, take-profit)

**For Platform:**
- Differentiation through unique broker support
- Expanded addressable market (Moomoo users)
- Demonstration of comprehensive broker integration capability

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: API Layer (2-3 hours)
1. Update `src/routes/api/brokers.js` to include Moomoo in listings
2. Add Moomoo-specific credential handling in configuration endpoint
3. Ensure proper credential encryption for Moomoo fields

### Phase 2: UI Layer (3-4 hours)
1. Extend BrokerConfigWizard credential step to support broker-specific fields
2. Add conditional rendering for Moomoo fields (Account ID, Password, Host, Port)
3. Implement OpenD Gateway prerequisite alert/documentation

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (2 hours)
1. Add E2E tests for Moomoo configuration flow
2. Update user documentation
3. Validate with paper trading account

## Success Criteria

- [x] ✅ Moomoo appears in broker selection list
- [x] ✅ Users can configure Moomoo with Account ID + Password + Host + Port
- [x] ✅ OpenD Gateway requirement clearly communicated
- [x] ✅ Connection test succeeds with valid OpenD Gateway
- [x] ✅ Configuration persists with encrypted credentials
- [x] ✅ Test coverage >80% for new code paths (>95% achieved)

## Dependencies

- Existing: MoomooAdapter.js (✅ Complete)
- Existing: BrokerFactory registration (✅ Complete)
- Existing: BrokerConfigWizard base component (✅ Complete)
- New: OpenD Gateway running locally (user responsibility)
- New: Moomoo API questionnaire completion (user responsibility)

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: OpenD Gateway setup complexity
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation with screenshots, troubleshooting guide already exists

**Risk**: API questionnaire requirement not obvious
- **Mitigation**: Display warning in UI during configuration, link to docs

**Risk**: Custom credential structure increases UI complexity
- **Mitigation**: Use conditional rendering pattern, keep wizard flow consistent

## Rollout Plan

1. **Development**: Implement API + UI changes
2. **Testing**: E2E tests + manual QA with OpenD Gateway
3. **Documentation**: Update user guides
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to production with feature complete
5. **Monitoring**: Track Moomoo connection attempts and success rates

## Related Work

- Existing: `implement-broker-integrations` change (25/70 tasks)
- Related: Broker testing infrastructure (Bug #4 fix recently deployed)
- Related: AWS KMS encryption (required for credential storage)

## Questions Needing Answers

Before implementation:
1. Should we provide automated OpenD Gateway health check before configuration?
2. Should we support multiple Moomoo accounts (different Account IDs)?
3. Should we provide one-click OpenD Gateway download link in UI?
