## Security & Performance

### Security Measures ✅

- **Credential Encryption**: All API keys encrypted at rest
- **Input Validation**: Symbol, quantity validation on all endpoints
- **Authentication Required**: All exchange endpoints require user auth
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user, per-exchange request tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on exchange API failures

### Performance Optimizations ✅

- **Price Data Caching**: 10-second TTL reduces API calls
- **Fee Structure Caching**: 5-minute TTL for fee data
- **Redis Support**: Distributed caching for production
- **In-Memory Fallback**: Development mode support
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: `/api/exchanges/rate-limit-status` endpoint
- **Cache Statistics**: `/api/exchanges/cache-stats` endpoint

---

1. **README.md**: Crypto exchange support section
2. **EXCHANGE-SETUP.md**: Step-by-step setup guides for Coinbase Pro and Kraken
3. **API Documentation**: Complete endpoint documentation with examples
4. **openspec/project.md**: Updated with exchange adapter implementations
